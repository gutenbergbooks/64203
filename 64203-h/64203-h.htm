1</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Author&rsquo;s object in
offering to the Public the following pages is, that all who have
a desire to examine the beauties of Welsh scenery may also have
an opportunity of seeing the most <i>interesting</i> portion of
it in a tour which will not occupy more than a month.&nbsp; The
route described in this volume presents a variety of pictures
which can scarcely be equalled, and certainly not surpassed, in
any quarter of the globe.&nbsp; It is true there are hills higher
far than any in Snowdonia, and valleys more extensive; but, while
we are astonished at a description of the enormous magnitude of
the Asiatic and American mountains, and the noble rivers, and
sea-like lakes of the latter, let us take into our consideration
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>which is the
most desirable country to explore; that in which nature&rsquo;s
prodigies are so extensive that we can neither ascend the
eminences, ford the rivers, nor view the opposite shores of the
extensive lakes; or <i>that</i> where mountains may be scaled
with ease, from the summits of which, a series of glorious
panoramas burst upon the eye,&mdash;wherein the valleys, glens
and wild ravines present an endless variety of sublimity and
beauty, and the loud torrent and the waterfall pour forth their
melody of never tiring sweetness, to delight the ear?</p>
<p>Seas must be crossed, and miles of dreary and uninteresting
country traversed, in wandering from one grand object to another
in the <i>former</i>; while, in the route here represented to the
Public,&mdash;within the reach of all&mdash;repose and admiration
charm the heart by turns, in the rich fertile valleys, lofty and
wood-clad hills, or heather-mantled mountains, of North
Wales.&nbsp; The traveller is likewise insured the comfort of a
good inn, where he may rest his wearied limbs, after a
day&rsquo;s ramble in whatever part of the district he chooses to
select for his excursion; and the healthy and active should
decidedly make <i>use</i> of their <i>limbs</i>, to bear them
through this tour, in <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>preference to the more easy and
luxurious vehicle, and even to the equestrian mode of
conveyance.&nbsp; A good horsewoman may venture into the dark
defiles, or climb the craggy heights upon the ponys, which are
always in readiness at the inns for that purpose; but between a
man and his steed there will most assuredly be a strong feeling
of sympathy created by a conviction, that the one is a most
unnecessary burthen to the other.</p>
<p>For the etchings which illustrate this little work, the Author
is indebted to his friend Mr. Alfred Clint, who accompanied him
in his second tour, and whose judicious selection of subjects has
given a value to the volume, which, without his aid, would have
been deficient in its principal ornaments.&nbsp; There is no
composition in any of the illustrations; they are the scenes of
nature reflected in the mirror of art.&nbsp; Not a mountain or
valley, grey ruin or waterfall, but is represented as it really
<i>is</i>; and for the best reason in the world, viz. that any
attempt to improve upon the subjects, would destroy their real
beauty.</p>
<p>The peasantry are simple, honest, and obliging; and, as they
trudge along, a spirit of <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>freedom sparkles in their eyes, and
seems to animate every action of their unfettered limbs.&nbsp;
Though their fare is humble, they enjoy it with an appetite to
which the bracing air of their hills, and their happy ignorance
of luxuries, give an enviable zest.&nbsp; Drunkenness is a vice
almost unknown among these primitive mountaineers: milk is their
common beverage, oatmeal cakes, and potatoes, with a plentiful
supply of trout from their native streams, form their chief
summer food; while, in winter, dry salted beef and mutton serve
to satisfy their utmost wishes.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though poor the peasant&rsquo;s hut, his
feasts tho&rsquo; small,<br />
He sees his little lot the lot of all.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms,<br />
And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms.<br />
And, as a child, when scaring sounds molest,<br />
Clings close and closer to the mother&rsquo;s breast,<br />
So the loud torrent, and the whirlwind&rsquo;s roar,<br />
But bind him to his native mountains more.&rdquo;</p>

5</span>DIRECTIONS<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO THOSE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE WELSH
LANGUAGE.</span></h2>
<p>A knowledge of the Welsh alphabet is indispensable to those
who are desirous of correctly pronouncing the necessary questions
and answers that transpire upon the road.&nbsp; The names of
places must effectually puzzle any tourist, who is not acquainted
with the peculiar sound of each letter, particularly where there
are many consonants in a word.&nbsp; In order therefore to aid
the traveller in Wales, I have selected the following rules.</p>
<p>In the Welsh alphabet there are no mutes; and all letters that
are circumflex must be pronounced long, as</p>
<p class="gutlist">B&ocirc;n like the English Bone.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Bin, as Been.</p>
<p class="gutlist">C, as Can, but never soft as in City.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Ch, is pronounced as the Greek &chi;.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Dd, as the English Th in theme.</p>
<p class="gutlist"><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>F, as V in English.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Ff, as F and double F in English.</p>
<p class="gutlist">G, as G in good, but never soft as in
genial.</p>
<p class="gutlist">I, as I in king but never as in fire.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Ll, as L aspirated.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Th, as in thought.</p>
<p class="gutlist">U, as I in the English words bliss, kiss
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="gutlist">W, as double O in good, wood.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Y, as U in burn, but in the last syllable of a
word; and in all monosyllables except Y, Ydd, Ym, Yn, Yr, Ys, Fy,
Dy, Myn, it is like I in Sin.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>By attending to these rules, the stranger will easily make
himself understood by the peasantry, and on his tours, in
enquiring for any place to which he may be journeying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Various</span>, as the features of human
nature, are the sources of human happiness.&nbsp; Some derive <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>their
choicest pleasure from historical accounts of men who lived in
by-gone ages, and in re-creating events that have long since been
engulphed in the abyss of time,&mdash;breaking down the barriers
of intervening years, and mingling, in idea, with those who were
once deemed the glorious of the earth, who now lie blended with
its grossest atoms, or are confounded with the purer
elements.&nbsp; Some, parching with the thirst of knowledge, seek
to slake the fever of their minds with most laborious research;
explore the utmost regions of the globe to find a shorter marine
passage; or pierce into its depths to seek for treasures which
only exist in their heated fancies.&nbsp; The vast ocean is
fathomed to satisfy the ruling principle of their
natures,&mdash;curiosity; and the realms of air traversed with
the same motive to insure the universally desired result,
self-gratification.&nbsp; While some, leaving the elements to
perform the destined changes, are willing to agree with the poet,
who in the warmth of his philanthropy exclaims:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The proper study of mankind is
man;&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The court, the city, and the country, present an endless
variety of subjects for contemplation; and the latter being the
region of delight to those whose business confines them to the
metropolis for the winter months, the author of this volume is
anxious to be thought a useful and an amusing companion to such
tourists who, in pursuit of health and the charms of nature, may
wander</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the Welsh vales &rsquo;mid mountains

<p>where the sublime and beautiful present themselves at every
turn to captivate the eye, and ruddy health colours the smiling
faces of every peasant girl and shepherd boy, from Chirk to
Holyhead.</p>
<p>To a mind capable of estimating fine scenery, how delightful
are the hurry and bustle which usually take place on the morning
of departure, <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>in fond expectation of realizing the anticipated
pleasure of viewing those beauties of nature the imagination has
but weakly painted!&nbsp; The sun is scarcely sooner up than the
traveller; and, although the coach in which he is to be rolled
some hundred and fifty miles will not start for perhaps three
hours, his anxiety preponderates over the now slighted comforts
of his bed of down, and with an agile leap he quits his restless
pillow, and hastily despatching the business of his toilet, with
his heart beating high, and his knapsack already stuffed with
three shirts, as many pairs of stockings, guide books, and as few
other necessaries as may be, in order to make his walking
wardrobe as light as possible, he prepares to &ldquo;take the
road.&rdquo;&nbsp; If a disciple of old Isaac Walton and Cotton,
he will not fail to have his book of flies, lines, reel, &amp;c.,
and a light fly rod to carry in his hand, and for which he is
sure to have use whenever he feels inclined for piscatory pastime
on his tour.&nbsp; So stocked and provided, he bids defiance to
the evils of life; and may exclaim with the poet</p>

15</span>&ldquo;Do you ride upon the box, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I do&mdash;paid that fellow to keep it for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir: mount if you please,&mdash;not a minute
to spare.&nbsp; All right behind there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold fast, sir!&mdash;let &rsquo;em go, Joey!&nbsp;
Blow avay, Bill,&rdquo; then addressing the near wheeler;
&ldquo;eh, vot, you&rsquo;re at your tantarums again!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll vork &rsquo;em out of you before ve gets to the end of
the stage.&nbsp; Do you know, sir, it vas all along of this here
varmint that ve&rsquo;d the upset last veek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! we&rsquo;ve a pleasant prospect before us,
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh there&rsquo;s no fear, sir; I vas never upset in my
life, and I&rsquo;ve been upon this here road for five and twenty
years come next Christmas; but it vas all along of a gemman as
had the reins in hand, ven poor Ned Burkem just vent in for his
mornins, at the King&rsquo;s Arms&mdash;yonder you may see the
sign just afore us; ve alvays stops there for our mornins, case
you see, sir, the landlord vas von of us, and his daughter is a
main pretty girl.&nbsp; I suppose, sir, you&rsquo;ve no objection
to look at a pretty girl, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None in the world, James.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;Veil, here ve are; and now, sir, if you&rsquo;ll
just lay hold of the ribbons for von minute, I&rsquo;ll leave
&rsquo;em this here parcel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this proposition I agreed, with the proviso that one ostler
should hold the tricksey mare, and another stand at the
leaders&rsquo; heads, having no wish for a repetition of poor old
Ned Burkem&rsquo;s mishap.&nbsp; The parcel being delivered, the
half pint of purl swallowed, and James again seated, like ruddy
Ph&oelig;bus, on the coach box, the horses were put in motion to
the tune of eleven miles an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very pretty travelling this, Mr. &mdash;, I beg your
pardon, sir, but your name is &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right, James.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veil, I thought I vas, sir; it&rsquo;s not always that
I can remember names, sir; for you must know that, although
I&rsquo;ve drove some thousands in my time, just seated where you
are, sir, at this present, I don&rsquo;t think I could remember
one half of their names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very surprising indeed, for a man of your
observation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord bless you, sir, vy my observation is nothing to
Squire &mdash;, that&rsquo;s his house you see on your left; they
say he can see the Eclipse <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>(coach) in the moon.&nbsp; But they
can&rsquo;t tool &rsquo;em along as ve does here, I take it,
sir.&nbsp; Go along, snarler!&rdquo;</p>
<p>James&rsquo;s tongue and the coach continued in rapid
progress; and in due time we reached the Sportsman Inn at
Whetstone, when the passengers had an opportunity of displaying
the extraordinary effects produced by the morning air upon
fasting stomachs.&nbsp; A lady and her daughter, who were inside
passengers, did ample justice to the fare; the latter, in
particular, payed away at the cold fowl and ham in a manner truly
surprising.&nbsp; &ldquo;Coach ready, ladies,&rdquo; cried James;
and up jumped mother and pet, with mouths full of fowl, toast,
etc., which they washed down, unmasticated, with the dregs of
their tea; and in a minute were again seated inside the coach,
opposite to two gentlemen, one rather a corpulent man, with
&ldquo;spectacles on nose,&rdquo; the other a gay young citizen,
who was to leave us at Barnet.</p>
<p>The coach had not started above five minutes, before fragrant
wreaths of smoke were making their escape out of the window, and
delighting the outside passengers with the refreshing odour: for
this we were indebted to the stout gentleman <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>before
mentioned, who having lately arrived from America, could not be
expected to understand the civilized customs of travellers in
England, and who inconsiderately concluded that his cigar was as
agreeable to the ladies as to himself.&nbsp; It proved otherwise,
however: the cold fowl lay uneasy, and the ham seemed to object
to being smoked.&nbsp; This, both ladies endeavoured to intimate
to their opposite neighbour, by sundry wry faces and beseeching
looks.&nbsp; At length, his cigar being nearly finished, the
smoker could no longer pretend blindness to the distressing
condition to which he had reduced his companions&mdash;and he
then asked &ldquo;if they had any objection to
smoking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elderly lady, whose politeness had extended to the utmost
limits of her nature, with a forced smile replied (while the ashy
paleness of her face spoke the tumult that was stirring within,)
&ldquo;Not the&mdash;slightest, sir, if you have no objection
to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo; open the other window, she would have
said, but the daughter could no longer support the motion of the
coach and the fumes of tobacco, and, to the horror of the
American gentleman, he instantly found himself in no very
enviable situation.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>He
started from his seat, and almost lifted the roof of the coach
off by the concussion between it and his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
objection, madam!&rdquo; cried he in great wrath; &ldquo;but I
wish you to understand that I have a very great objection to
this, I calculate!&mdash;Here, coachman! stop! let me get out!
will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coachee complied, and the ladies were doubly relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a pretty considerable pickle, I&rsquo;m
thinking!&rdquo; said he, as he seated himself behind us on the
roof.</p>
<p>The more agreeable rattle of the wheels prevented our hearing
more of his complaints, and we arrived at Barnet.</p>
<p>About a mile and a half from Barnet, upon the right, is the
estate of Mr. Byng, and a little further, on the left, that of
Mr. Trotter.&nbsp; The town of St. Albans with its ancient Abbey,
which creates pleasing ideas of bygone times, of monks and
friars, &ldquo;fat pullets and clouted cream,&rdquo; was passed
through; and descending the hill, on leaving the town, fresh
objects became interesting to the eye.</p>
<p>After leaving Gorham Bury, Earl Verulam&rsquo;s seat on the
left, we came to Market Street and <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>passed a delightful residence called
Market Cell, the property of a Mr. Johnson, and beyond Sir F. P.
Turner&rsquo;s on the right, and Mr. Duncombe&rsquo;s on the
left, are places that make a man desirous of possessing
&pound;10,000 per annum.</p>
<p>Dunstable is rattled through next, and then comes <i>Fenny
Stratford</i>, <i>Stony Stratford</i>, <i>Easton Neston</i>, and
then <i>Lord Pomfret&rsquo;s</i> noble domain.&nbsp;
<i>Towcester</i> comes next upon the list, and <i>Weedon
Barracks</i>, where a view of the rail road presents itself.</p>
<p>Then the coach enters Dunchurch, changing horses at the Dun
Inn; where being pretty well roasted in the hot sun, some of the
passengers endeavoured to obtain a draught of something to
moisten their parched throats; but if the garrison of Weedon had
discharged all their powder in firing an alarm, and the bells of
Dunchurch had joined in the uproar, I do not think a single soul
would have answered the summons in the Dun Inn.&nbsp; We were
obliged therefore to ascend again, with throats unquenched.</p>
<p>From Dunchurch the coach passes through a noble avenue of elms
and firs which stretches for six miles beyond the village,
certainly the <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>finest avenue, in extent, I ever beheld; and the size of
the trees is not the least interesting object, spreading their
luxuriant branches until they form almost a continuous bower.</p>
<p>Coventry sends forth her store of ragged urchins to see the
London coach come in, and peeping Tom, in effigy, looks as
inquisitive as peeping Tom himself could have done.</p>
<p><i>Aylesley Church</i> is a very beautiful structure; and a
little beyond is Packington Hall, the Mansion of Lord
Aylesford.</p>
<p>At Bucknell, another view of the railroad is obtained; and at
length, to the infinite joy of hungry passengers, Birmingham, and
dinner, appear in the distance.</p>
<p>We drew up to the inn.&nbsp; I was the only passenger who
entered the dining room.&nbsp; The coach was to stop for twenty
minutes; and after waiting ten with the patience of a stoic, the
waiter entered with a calf&rsquo;s head, cold, over which some
boiling water had been poured, by way of sauce.&nbsp; I am fond
of a mealy potatoe, and some were placed before me thoroughly
saturated; a cauliflower, boiled in the scented waters of fifty
other vegetables, completely scared away my appetite, <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>and fully
answered the purposes both of landlord and coachman.</p>
<p>The latter at that moment popping his head in at the door,
&ldquo;Coach ready, sir, if you please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it; what&rsquo;s to pay, my
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three and sixpence for dinner, sir, if you please, and
threepence for ale.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Experience makes fools wise,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I exclaimed, as with an empty stomach I reseated myself upon
the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;St&mdash;st&mdash;go along! a fine town this,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so, sir?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was in such a half starved, hungry looking
place in my life,&rdquo; cried I, at that time feeling the
cravings of nature strong within me, and fancying I saw the ghost
of a London cook shop, flitting before my eyes.</p>
<p>The road from Birmingham to Shrewsbury, if travelled by night,
gives a stranger a glowing idea of the &ldquo;fiery
regions,&rdquo; never mentioned to &ldquo;ears
polite.&rdquo;&nbsp; No description can come up to <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>the flaming
reality exhibited in the appearance of this country; hundreds of
hills of burning coke blaze in all directions, and the air is
scarcely endurable from the gaseous qualities of the smoke, which
sweeps across the road in huge columns, almost suffocating every
passenger who ventures upon that dismal tract.</p>
<p>But increasing horrors gather round the devoted tourist as he
advances further, on the road to Wolverhampton: thousands of
indistinct forms move in the glare of the distant fires, or flit,
like a legion of black devils, over the burning coals; sometimes
standing in bold relief before the blazing chimneys of fifty or
sixty steam engines, that send up bursts of flame glaring in all
directions; and imagination might picture thousands of fallen
angels, tossing their flaming brands above their heads, in
frantic sport and direful revelry.</p>
<p>Groups of grinning imps sat scattered near the road side,
whose yellings made the welkin ring again as we passed by
them.&nbsp; Roaring Bacchanals filled the air with their drunken
shouts; and withered hags held out their bony hands for alms, to
be expended in liquid fire for their throats.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Behind
me, on the roof of the coach, were two most eccentric travellers
who had taken their places at Birmingham for Shrewsbury.&nbsp;
The night was cold, and one, whom I discovered to be of the
Emerald Isle, had, with national foresight, provided himself with
a dacent drop of &ldquo;the mountain dew,&rdquo; just to keep the
wind off his stomach; and next to him was seated a demure looking
personage, who by his peculiar dialect proved to be a son of
Scotia&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Land of the mountain and the
flood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;By the honor of Erin!&rdquo; exclaimed the first,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all surprised to find you such a silent
companion, for it&rsquo;s a mighty cowld night, and your
conversation must nat&rsquo;rally freeze before its spoken.&nbsp;
Will you take a drop of comfort to thaw it, my darlint?&rdquo; at
the same time presenting a flask of potheen to the party he
addressed.</p>
<p>It must be observed that this sprig of shamrock was dressed in
a blue jacket, with a light summer waistcoat, and a pair of duck
trowsers, which suited admirably the mid-day ride, but were
inefficient to exclude the cold night air.&nbsp; <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>But I suppose
he went, like the generality of his countrymen, upon the
philosophical principle, that &ldquo;a light heart and a thin
pair of breeches goes thorough the world, my brave
boys.&rdquo;&nbsp; His companion was dressed in a velvet shooting
jacket, thick plush trowsers, and waistcoat of the same, over
which he wore a heavy box coat, which was encased in a cloth
cloak of unusual dimensions: over this was a mackintosh cape, and
his head was enveloped in a fur cap, fastened by an Indian silk
handkerchief tied round the chin&mdash;and altogether he seemed
to defy wind and weather.</p>
<p>This bundle of comfort, pulling down for an instant the
neckerchief, which was also rolled round the aperture of speech,
emphatically stated that he had no need of the offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ye ken,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m a
prudent mon, and never venture outside o&rsquo; the coach, unless
I have a&rsquo; the comforts o&rsquo; the inside about me;
there&rsquo;s ne&rsquo;er a mon, sir, shut up in that unhealthy
box, ye may ken, but is caulder than mysel; and I guess,
fra&rsquo; the garments on your person, that ye&rsquo;re no quite
sae warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why thin if I was, I&rsquo;d be thinking myself <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>nearer to a
certain personage than I have any inclination to be for the next
half century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ye ken that extremes meet; and I think by that
calculation ye may be nearer to the friend ye mention than I am,
seeing that I am but just comfortable, and ye are near the
freezing point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having uttered this sarcasm upon his shivering companion, the
canny Scot replaced the muffler over his lips, as a signal for
silence, while the Irishman, taking another draught from his
pocket pistol, sang a stanza of Erin go bragh, and consoled
himself with striking a light for his cigar, from which he sent
clouds of smoke, which made our travelling convenience resemble,
in the gloom, a steam carriage, as it flew along, with nearly as
great rapidity; the lighted end serving, as a warming pan to his
nose, which thus illuminated, seemed not much unlike a blue
light, such as mariners burn for signals of distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Boxer,&rdquo; said he, touching
me on the shoulder, &ldquo;but are you a politician?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to say the truth, sir,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I
interfere as little as possible with what, I conceive, wiser
heads than mine are greatly puzzled.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s true, sure enough,&rdquo;
continued he, &ldquo;but may be you&rsquo;ve heard of
the&mdash;holloa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he was interrupted by his bulky companion, whom a lurch
of the coach had flung heavily upon him as he was leaning forward
to reach my ear.&nbsp; The Scotchman had fallen asleep, and
effectually prevented his neighbour from regaining his sitting
posture, by the weight of his body and its envelopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood an&rsquo; &rsquo;ounds, man, what are ye
about?&rdquo; roared my friend in the thin inexpressibles.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sure I might as well be porter to Atlas himself, and carry
his load.&nbsp; Will you get up, if you please?&nbsp; By the
shade of O&rsquo;Donahue, but I&rsquo;ll create a connexion
betwixt your nose and the lighted end of my cigar, if you
don&rsquo;t let me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sonorous grunt, which drowned the rattle of the coach
wheels, was the only reply to this appeal, and Paddy being
unacquainted with the language, immediately put his threat into
execution.&nbsp; I have said before it was a cold night, and
Sandy, who naturally enough started, at the application of the
cigar to his proboscis, from his ideal world to a dreamy
consciousness of his real <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>situation, placing his hand on the
injured part, exclaimed, still half bewildered, &ldquo;Eh!
that&rsquo;s vera true, indeed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a cauld night,
and I verily believe that my nose is frost-bitten.&nbsp; I maun
pit t&rsquo;other shawl round it;&rdquo; saying which he dragged
one from his pocket, and was completely enveloped, apparently to
suffocation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why then, I&rsquo;ve heard of salamanders, but Scotland
must be mighty cauld since you left it,&rdquo; said my thinly
clad fellow traveller, when a half smothered voice spoke through
the rolls of shawls and silk handkerchiefs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
find yoursel&rsquo; sae hot in my company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The castinet-like sounds of the Irishman&rsquo;s teeth was the
only reply to this question, and silence ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What column is that we are approaching,
coachman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why that, sir, is a pillar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye; but what was it placed there for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, it was put there by subscription, as a
compliment to Lord Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The column is of the Doric order, rising from a base.&nbsp;
The angles are ornamented with lions <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>couchant, and the height of the
pillar is 132 feet; upon its summit was placed a figure which old
Push-along assured me was a fine likeness of old Rowley; it was
erected in 1814.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow the horn, Ned, will you!&rdquo;&nbsp; And now,
rattling over stones, through streets crowded with youthful
idlers assembled to catch a sight of the new comers, we rapidly
approached the inn.&nbsp; In a moment more we were at the gate of
the Lion.</p>
<p>A good supper and a comfortable bed made amends for the bad
dinner and the cold ride, and in the morning I arose much
refreshed, and sallied forth to view the town.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">FITZ-GWARINE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> breakfasting at the inn, I,
like the honorable Dick Dowlass, with my wardrobe on my back, and
a light heart, proceeded on the road to Chirk.</p>
<p>The Severn, to the right, winded beautifully towards the
ancient town I left behind.&nbsp; Bees hummed&mdash;birds
sang&mdash;and blossoms sent forth <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>their fragrance to delight the
traveller as he gaily trudged &ldquo;the footpath
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cheerfulness was above, beneath, around me, and
in my heart.&nbsp; I paused upon the bridge at Montford, to take
a lingering farewell of the sweet flowing Severn, its wooded
banks and meadows gay; and was about to commence a sublime
soliloquy, when I was accosted by an elderly personage in a straw
hat, fustian shooting coat, knee-breeches, gaiters and
shoes.&nbsp; He had a stout cudgel in his hand, and a knapsack,
more capacious than mine, strapped across his shoulders.&nbsp; He
appeared to be about fifty-five years of age, and being furnished
like myself, it struck me that a passing traveller might
naturally enough take us for father and son.</p>
<p>Fortunately we were both pursuing the same route, and a
desultory dialogue commenced with the never failing
observation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A noble river this, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great admirer of the charms of nature, I presume,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An enthusiastic one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re for the Welsh vales, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mountains high!&rdquo; I exclaimed, warming to my
loquacious companion.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the Welsh vales &rsquo;mid mountains
high,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sang he, in a hearty, round-toned voice, with which I chimed
in, and we were the best friends, on a sudden.</p>
<p>There certainly is no society so interesting as that picked up
by the tourist, who leaves with contempt the starched formalities
of a great city behind him, and walks forth, unencumbered by
care, to enjoy the society of mankind in its varied and
unsophisticated nature.&nbsp; Every person we meet affords us
information and delight; for a kindred spirit animates almost
every individual whom you may chance to encounter in countries
remarkable for beauties of scenery, and especially in a region
like North Wales, where inns of the best kind are situated at the
most convenient points, and the foot passenger is treated with as
much respect as a lord in his carriage with four post
horses.&nbsp; The landlords of inns here, think that a man may
make the proper use of his legs without being a beggar; and that
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>the
costume of a pedestrian may cover the form of a gentleman.&nbsp;
And this philanthropic conception contributes to form that happy
combination, civil hosts and merry travellers.</p>
<p>There is no want of society, nor any difficulty in selecting
that with which you are best pleased, for every evening brings in
fresh comers from various quarters to the different places of
rest and refreshment.&nbsp; The exchange of information
respecting routes, the different adventures of the day, the
peculiar feelings displayed in their recital, and countenances
lit up with pleasure, give a degree of animation to the evening,
never to be equalled in the brilliant drawing-room, the blaze of
which seems to put out the eyes of reason,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And men are&mdash;what they name not to
themselves,<br />
And trust not to each other.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I soon discovered that my companion was a traveller of no
common information; that he was a collector of legends, an
antiquarian, and a geologist; and congratulated myself upon
meeting with one who, as he gave me to understand, was intimately
acquainted with a variety of circumstances, <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>not generally
known, which had taken place in &ldquo;days of yore,&rdquo; upon
the very ground we were about to traverse, and which he had
frequently visited before.</p>
<p>He had been an actor in his youth, and as the scenery between
Mountford Bridge and the village of Wittington has little to
engage the attention, I will here relate a portion of his early
history, with which he amused me during our journey.</p>
<h3>HISTRIONIC AMBITION.</h3>
<p>It was a foggy morning when Triptolemus,&mdash;for so I shall
designate my new acquaintance,&mdash;who had unfortunately been
deeply bitten by a mad actor, arose, feverish from his sleepless
pillow, to awaken the cocks of the surrounding neighbourhood with
the loud rattle of his histrionic tongue.&nbsp; He had, with some
difficulty, prevailed upon the manager of the theatre to permit
him to make his appearance on the stage, and the character
selected for his attempt was Richmond&mdash;the gallant
Richmond!</p>
<p>In the centre of the filthy town of &mdash; stands an ancient
castle, situated upon a lofty hill, which is now turned into a
county jail.&nbsp; There <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>was around it formerly a deep moat,
which having for many years been dried up, is now converted into
pleasure gardens for the corporation.&nbsp; From the top of the
hill there was, at this time, an opening, much like a trap door,
where commenced a descent by winding steps, leading to the
gardens beneath, and to some gates made in the iron railings that
encompassed the moat upon the other side.</p>
<p>Upon the summit of the hill, Triptolemus walked with all the
dignity of an English baron.&nbsp; The ancient fortress, that
frowned above him, gave additional fire to his excited
imagination; and, as he spoke of knights and fellows in arms, and
mused of war, banners, and crop ear&rsquo;d steeds, the present
peaceful times were dead to him, and nothing lived within his
gallant thoughts but those whose bones have long since whitened
in the dust.</p>
<p>Triptolemus had walked round, and round again, about the
distance of half a mile, spouting Shakespeare to &ldquo;the
unconscious wind,&rdquo; when, as he was about to take
&ldquo;round the third,&rdquo; instead of looking at the earth,
his inspired glance was directed to the sky; and at the instant
he exclaimed, &ldquo;thus far into the <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>bowels of the land,&rdquo; he
vanished into the earth through the before mentioned trap door!
and awakening from his surprize, he found himself half smothered
in a bed of manure, at the bottom of the steps.&mdash;When he had
in some degree recovered from his alarm, and ascertained that his
person had escaped injury, his first reflection was upon the fall
of Lucifer,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From night to morn&mdash;from morn to dewy
eve,<br />
A summer&rsquo;s day!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then looked round him and fancied himself in
Johnson&rsquo;s happy valley, himself the prince, and, like him,
discontented with his lot, when he was suddenly aroused to a
sense of his real situation by the pointed application of a
pitchfork, unceremoniously handled by a sturdy boor, who saluted
him with, &ldquo;Where the devil didst thee come
from?&rdquo;&nbsp; His indignant spirit now gave vent to its
uncontrollable fury, in a torrent of blank verse!&nbsp; He felt
that, like Hamlet, he could</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do
such deeds<br />
As hell itself would quake to look upon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, like Posthumous, he was doubtful which to <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>select.&nbsp;
His soul was in arms!&mdash;and the thrice valiant embryo
Richmond exclaimed,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thrice is he arm&rsquo;d that hath his
quarrel just;<br />
And he but naked, tho&rsquo; lock&rsquo;d up in steel,<br />
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I fell into this damned place through your neglect in
leaving the trap door open, you bloody and devouring
boar,&rdquo;&mdash;eyeing him all the while with a glance that
seemed to say, &ldquo;If I thought you wholesome, I&rsquo;d turn
cannibal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bumkin, however, took no further notice of it than to
assure him, if he did not presently take to his heels, he would
toss him out on the prongs of his fork.</p>
<p>O! what a field for fancy did this threat open to his
susceptible mind!&nbsp; The tattered hat of the unceremonious
gardener was converted into a coronet of snakes that reared their
threatening crests and hissed furiously at the astonished
hero.&nbsp; His ruddy face assumed the Gorgon&rsquo;s look,
turning him almost into stone.&nbsp; The weapon in his hand grew
fiery red, and for a foot there seemed a cloven hoof.</p>
<p>An attempted application of the torturing steel <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>however, gave
motion to his limbs;&mdash;away he scampered up the steep ascent,
not daring to turn a solitary glance behind, until he reached the
spot from whence he fell.</p>
<p>This accident conjured up a train of reflections upon the
vanity of human wishes!&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; exclaimed he,
&ldquo;it is but a few minutes since I fancied myself a hero at
the head of a victorious army, before which thousands would turn
and fly, or grimly bite the dust; and now I find myself a
wretched thing! routed by a base born hind with a muck fork in
his hand!&nbsp; Oh! vile disgrace!&nbsp; I only wish that fellow
may see me on the boards to-morrow night&mdash;I&rsquo;ll frown
him into a liquid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon the night of this eventful morning the stage-struck
Triptolemus had very unquiet dreams; his head was filled, he
said, with a chaotic mass of indistinct and indescribable
objects.&nbsp; The last thought he had while awake was how he
should look when dressed as the gallant Richmond;&mdash;and
having settled that point to his own satisfaction, he resigned
himself to</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sweet Nature&rsquo;s second
course.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He waves aloft his glittering steel&mdash;he spurs his <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>coal black
charger to the field.&mdash;Forward! he cries&mdash;and the
hostile ranks advance in terrible array, inspired by their heroic
leader!&nbsp; All then becomes hubbub, turmoil and confusion,
higglety pigglety, up and down, slash away work.&nbsp; He meets
the tyrant king&mdash;fiercely they struggle for the
mastery&mdash;slap bang go their battle axes; when suddenly a
number of shadowy forms, with blood-red cabbage-heads, encircle
the enfuriated pair, yelling and dancing at the white-rose
king;&mdash;the gallant Richmond staggers beneath the prowess of
his vigorous opponent, and half believes the field is lost, when
through the spectre group a headless horseman breaks with furious
speed.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis Buckingham!&mdash;he waves his gory head
aloft in his red hand, and as Tydides whirled the fragment of a
rock upon his foe, even with such fury flung the shade his head,
full upon the visage of his fated Richard;&mdash;he
falls&mdash;the shadows vanish with loud cries of joy! when
suddenly a dreadful blow is dealt upon the temples of the
conquering Richmond;&mdash;the chains of sleep are broken, and
Triptolemus lies stretched upon the floor.</p>
<p>He arose confused; he pondered upon his dream, rubbed his
bruised forehead, and began <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>conclusions from the visions of the
night.&nbsp; These proving satisfactory, he descended to the
breakfast parlour, inwardly exclaiming,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May good digestion wait on
appetite.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rehearsal in the morning gave additional confidence, the
manager having pronounced it a very promising specimen of his
ability.</p>
<p>Night came&mdash;and he was at his post three hours before his
presence would be required upon the stage.&nbsp; His hair, of
which he had a great profusion, was twisted into innumerable
curls by a one-eyed frizzeur who received a payment of twelve
pence per night from the manager for decorating the heads of his
talented performers; his limbs were cased in the warlike
habiliments of the 15th century, which (with the trifling
inconvenience, occasioned by their being made for a person of
nearly double his dimensions some twenty years before, and the
few dilapidations they had received from the numberless falls,
thwacks, rents, etc. during their long and faithful servitude)
gave him the appearance of a warrior of some personal
endowments.&nbsp; The helmet was peculiarly formed, resembling
that worn in <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>the 14th century; for this appendage to the son of Mars
had been neglected until the very last moment, when it was
supposed to be impossible to procure one; but Triptolemus, ever
fertile in resources, seized upon a shining tin saucepan, in
which the Duke of Buckingham had brought some barley water to the
theatre for the purpose of clearing his voice, emptied its
contents, and having divested it of its handle, made of it an
admirable completion to his costume.&nbsp; At the end of the
first act, he walked, with all the self possession of a veteran
stager, into an apartment called the green-room, but which
exhibited a clear face of white-wash, emblematic of those who
frequented its chaste precincts.&nbsp; It was furnished with
chairs, stools, and a huge family sofa, evidently the work of the
&ldquo;olden time.&rdquo;&nbsp; This seemed a seat suited to
Triptolemus, puffed out as he was with the pride of his
appearance; but unfortunately the light comedian, when playing
the part of Doricourt, fell so heavily upon it, in the mad scene,
that he made a fatal breach in the bottom, which as yet had not
undergone a repair.&nbsp; King Henry the sixth (a short, stout,
pompous man, who never moved but one arm in acting, and that with
the exact motion of a pump <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>handle) was seated on one side of the
fire place, in an altitude of deep thought.&nbsp; Triptolemus
remembered his dream, and was astonished at the close resemblance
between the red cabbage head of the shadow and the rubicund
visage of the portly personage in the chimney corner.&nbsp; His
surprise was the greater for that he had not met this gentleman
at the rehearsal, he having sent an apology for his absence,
being hotly engaged (as he termed it) in <i>making his
benefit</i>, i.e. paying his respects to the different taverns in
the town, where his merry associates congregated to drink porter,
smoke tobacco, and distribute as many tickets as an insinuating
address and consummate assurance would enable them to dispose of
amongst their boon companions.</p>
<p>The fourth act is over; and Triptolemus experiences a strange
sensation rising from the bottom of his abdomen and gradually
spreading itself over his whole body!&mdash;he feels less valiant
than when first he donned the shining helmet (alias saucepan) and
fastened the glittering falchion to his mailed side.&nbsp; Ting a
ring ting! goes the prompter&rsquo;s bell!&nbsp; Triptolemus was
trembling at his post.&nbsp; The music ceases&mdash;the curtain
rises&mdash;the martial music is played loudly behind <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>the scenes,
and the audience with breathless anxiety await the entrance of
the dauntless hero, the brave Earl of Richmond.</p>
<p>The trumpeters have almost split their cheeks,&mdash;the
troops march on, two and two&mdash;the Earl of Oxford then
advances, next Sir James Blunt, and then Sir Walter
Herbert.&nbsp; Triptolemus who had been advised to appear last,
and with a rush to &ldquo;take the natives by surprise,&rdquo; as
it is termed in theatrical phraseology, now darted forward to the
footlights, &ldquo;swift as an arrow from the Tartar
bow.&rdquo;&nbsp; The applause was deafening, and made him fancy
that the gods were at war above him; nor was he much out in his
conceit, for a chimney sweeper who had edged himself into the
centre of the gallery at that moment, caused such a commotion
amongst the goddesses, that they assisted, with their screams,
the general uproar, and shouts and cat calls &ldquo;shook the
pond&rsquo;rous roof.&rdquo;&nbsp; This state of commotion was
too violent to last, and at length silence was obtained, and the
hero commenced&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus far into the bowels of the
land&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the figure of the uncivil gardener met <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>his eyes,
seated in the front row of the pit, and grinning like a Scotch
terrier with a hair-lip.&nbsp; He made a full stop at this
apparition!&nbsp; &ldquo;Have we marched on,&rdquo; came the word
from the prompter&mdash;&ldquo;Have we marched
on,&rdquo;&mdash;echoed Oxford.&nbsp; But all was mist before
Richmond&rsquo;s eyes, indignation was in his heart and silence
upon his tongue.&nbsp; Unable to utter a word more, with a
flourish of his truncheon he made a furious exit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have we marched off,&rdquo; said the gallant
Blunt&mdash;and stalked off with the whole army (six in number)
after his heroic leader.&nbsp; The scene changed for
Richard&rsquo;s entrance.&mdash;Shame and fury battledoor&rsquo;d
our hero about with unmerciful rapidity behind the scenes!&nbsp;
He split his wooden truncheon upon the scull of an unlucky
lamplighter who stood in his way, and then the call boy&rsquo;s
awful voice was heard bidding him prepare for his second
scene.&nbsp; This he managed to get through tolerably well,
taking especial care to avoid another glance at the
gardener&rsquo;s fatal countenance.</p>
<p>All went on smoothly enough, until the scene where Richard
rushes on the stage in the midst of alarums, crying out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What ho! young Richmond ho!&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, as ill luck
would have it, Richmond could not find his <i>fighting sword</i>,
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and his
confusion was so great, when Richard again roared out,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Richard calls!&rdquo; Richmond rebellowed from
behind the scenes, &ldquo;Call and be d&mdash;d,&rdquo; thinking
the actor was taking an unwarrantable liberty in calling for him
before so many people in such an authoritative style.</p>
<p><i>Richard</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say come forth, and singly face
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Richmond</i>, (behind) &ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s the
use of my coming, when I can&rsquo;t find my sword?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length, the combatants met, Richmond having picked up a
powerful weapon, instead of the short, blunt and harmless sword
intended for the encounter.&nbsp; It was keen, long, and pointed,
like a lancet&mdash;a terrible weapon in unpractised hands.</p>
<p><i>Richard</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you remember the cuts?&rdquo;
(in an undertone, with doubting fear).</p>
<p><i>Richmond</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, d&mdash;n the cuts!&rdquo;
at the same time dealing a blow that laid open the shin of the
crook backed tyrant, who, thinking it better to die at once in
jest, than to be killed outright in earnest, fell down
exclaiming, &ldquo;Perdition catch thy arm! you&rsquo;ve cut my
leg open!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span><i>Richmond</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my soul, I
could&rsquo;nt help it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Richard</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;But oh&mdash;! the vast renown
thou hast acquired&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much for the audience to bear&mdash;&ldquo;their
visible muscles unmasterly grew,&rdquo; and the champions were
mutually discomposed.</p>
<p><i>Richmond</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;What the devil are they laughing
at?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Richard</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;At you to be sure, &lsquo;in
conquering Richard.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here another burst of merriment broke from the spectators, and
Triptolemus, turning his head, to check, with a high tragedy
look, their ill timed mirth, beheld, to his horror and dismay,
the inveterate gardener standing upon the front bench of the pit,
waving his arms like the sails of a windmill, and who no sooner
caught a full view of his countenance than he roared out,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blest if it bea&rsquo;nt he that I turned up
wi&rsquo; my pitch fork out of the muck heap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s over!&rdquo; exclaimed Richard, and gave up
the ghost, with his back turned to the audience, which created a
fresh peal of laughter, groans and hisses.&nbsp; Richmond,
shocked <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>at
the un-Cesarian position of the monarch, strove to obtain
silence, while he spoke the tag, by turning him over with his
face to the footlights&mdash;which he did with his foot, placing
Richard&rsquo;s nose within half an inch of the burning oil, who
grinned his disapprobation of such usage, till the audience
shrieked with mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ring down the curtain, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
shrieked the manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop till I&rsquo;ve spoken the tag!&rdquo; cried
Richmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ring down for the sake of my nose,&rdquo; bawled the
corpse.&nbsp; Ting a ring ting! went the prompter&rsquo;s bell,
and down fell the curtain, leaving one half of Richard&rsquo;s
body in view of the laughter-weeping spectators, which was at
last dragged by the heels from their sight by the indignant
Richmond, vowing, he never would again act with so diabolical a
<i>Richard</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This story, which amused me exceedingly, was during the
recital often interrupted by my hearty bursts of laughter, and
beguiled the time admirably, until we arrived at a miserable
place called <i>New Inn</i>, where we refreshed ourselves with a
glass of ale, and proceeded on our journey.</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>Branching off from the Oswestry road, to the right, we
pursued our way to Wittington, beguiling the time with anecdote
and song, light hearts and heels carrying us along the road like
things of air.&nbsp; Nothing worthy of notice took place until we
reached the village of Wittington, and there the first objects
that attracted our mutual attention, were two brick houses,
perfectly plain in their exterior, upon the front of the first of
which was written, in prodigious characters, <i>Search the
Scriptures</i>, and upon the second, <i>Remember thou keep holy
the Sabbath day</i>, with underneath, <i>Morrison&rsquo;s pills
sold here</i>.</p>
<p>The village is beautifully intersected with trees, and the
houses are examples of neatness and simplicity.&nbsp; The people
look cheerful and contented; and every shrub or flower which here
profusely expands, seems proudly to rejoice and flourish in this
charming retreat.</p>
<p>A walk through this village will make the tourist thoroughly
acquainted, in his own belief, with the persons who inhabit it,
although he never heard the history of one of them, from the
rector to the tinker.&nbsp; The first portrait that rises in his
imagination is the venerable curate, with contentment beaming in
his mild eyes, his silver <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>locks flowing over his well-brushed
thread-bare coat, with snow-white neck-cloth, mended small
clothes, black hose and polished shoes, visiting the cottage of
some invalid&mdash;a lovely girl, scarce sixteen, the rose of the
village, who had long been stretched upon a bed of sickness, but
now blessed with returning health, seated at the door, the fresh
evening air playing with her fair locks, the woodbine clustering
over her head, a slight tinge of vermilion spreading on her
cheeks, her eyes upraised in pious gratitude to heaven, and to
him who prayed beside her, and for her, morning and evening, and
who now with grateful heart holds up his hands to the Creator, in
thankfulness for her convalescence.</p>
<p>The next object is the village surgeon; a busy, merry,
bustling, prying, talkative, little gentleman, who amuses one
patient with all the scandal he has been able to pick up about
another; but, notwithstanding, a most important person, and
people feign illness for the gratification his visits
communicate; constant in his morning calls from house to house,
he continues to pick up all the flying rumours of the day; and at
night is, of course, the object looked up to, in all parties, as
the oracle, in whom all the <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>secrets of the village are deposited,
while he is cautious not to commit himself, by imprudent
exposures.</p>
<p>Then comes the lawyer, with snuff-coloured riding coat with
brass buttons, top-booted, and spurred, who does very well for
himself, by <i>doing</i> his neighbours in a professional
way.</p>
<p>Then come the ladies, who are of course all nature, no art,
sweetness, simplicity, and all that; but as I am not going to
write a volume upon rural life, I will just give a short
description of</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">WITTINGTON CASTLE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In ancient days, of high renown,<br />
Not always did yon castle frown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With ivy crested brow;<br />
Nor were its walls with moss embrowned,<br />
Nor hung the lanky weeds around<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That fringe its ruins now.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Fitz-Gwarine</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the year 843, when Roderick the Great was King of Wales, a
British noble, named Ynyr ap Cadfarch, built the Castle of
Wittington.&nbsp; He was succeeded by his son Tudor Trevor, <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>whose
descendants possessed it for many generations; and many families
at this day trace their origin to him.</p>
<p>At the Conquest, Wittington became the property of Pain
Peveril, who dying without issue, it was seized by Roger, Earl of
Shrewsbury, and passed into the hands of Hugh, his son, who was
succeeded by his brother Robert; but he being defeated by Henry
I, the castle was restored to the Peverils, in the person of Sir
William Peveril, who was a great warrior, and is said to have
miraculously recovered from a (supposed) <i>mortal wound</i> by
eating the shield of a wild boar.&nbsp; He had a daughter named
Mellet, whose exceeding beauty attracted many suitors; but, being
of Amazonian mind, she declared she would marry none but the
knight who proved himself best and bravest in the field.&nbsp;
Her father published this declaration, and promised the Castle of
Wittington as her dower.&nbsp; The trial took place at the Peak
in Derbyshire, and Guarine de Metz, who had a shield of silver,
and a peacock crest, overcame all his rivals, and obtained the
beautiful Mellet.&nbsp; His posterity, for nine generations,
assumed the name of Fulk, a race of heroes who performed
extraordinary feats of arms, and for <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>a full account of which the reader is
referred to the history of Wittington, a little book of forty-one
pages, by William Davies, L.M.W.S., Head Master of Caernarven
School.</p>
<p>The ninth, and last Fulk Fitz Gwarine, died here in his
minority, in the reign of Henry IV, and his sister Elizabeth, the
heiress to the estates, married Richard Hankfdd, who left his
possessions to his only daughter Thomasine, who married Sir
William Bourchire, brother to Henry, the first Earl of Essex; and
the title of Lord Fitz Warine was given to Sir William, in
consequence of his marriage.</p>
<p>John, the third in descent from him, exchanged Wittington with
Henry VIII for other landed property.&nbsp; This John was the
first Earl of Bath, and his family retained the name of
Fitz-Warren until the race became extinct, which took place at
the death of Henry, the fifth Earl of Bath.&nbsp; This place was
presented by Elizabeth, to Henry Grey Duke of Suffolk, who
fortified it in consequence of several crimes imputed to him by
the bigot Mary, who granted it to Fitz-Alan, the last Earl of
Arundel, who mortgaged it to a number of London citizens, and
William Albany, the chief amongst them was appointed <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>sole
possessor of it, and by the marriage of whose grand daughter it
fell into the hands of Thomas Lloyd Aston Esq. in whose family it
now remains.</p>
<p>The castle underwent fortification soon after its original
establishment; and must have been alternately in the hands of the
Welsh and Saxons in these wars.&nbsp; It is well supplied with
spring water, and the moats, and entrenchments surrounding the
castle are still discernible.&nbsp; The keep was fortified with
five round towers, each 40 feet in diameter and 100 in height,
the walls being 12 feet in thickness.&mdash;All are now in
ruins.</p>
<p>In 1809, a well was discovered in the Keep, at the bottom of
which was found a pair of iron fetters for the legs, and a jug,
stags&rsquo; heads, swords, a head curiously carved, and a number
of richly gilt glass bottles.&nbsp; In the trenches there are
growing some very fine tall wych trees.&nbsp; The castle is
situated in the midst of fertile meadows; and a rapid stream,
which a mile above takes a subterranean course, here breaks into
light again, amidst fringing poplars, and entering the moat,
encompasses the walls, which are richly festooned with ivy, and
adorned with wild flowers <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>and woodbines.&nbsp; It there enters
the Perry, in the meadows below, which were formerly an extensive
lake, and the ancient fosses and entrenchments may be traced to
where the lake terminated, at a surprising distance westward,
beyond the castle.</p>
<p>The church is a rectory, and was originally designed as a
chapel to the castle.&nbsp; It is dedicated to St. John the
Baptist.&nbsp; The body of the church was rebuilt in 1806, and in
the register are the following curious epitaphs:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">March 13, 1766, died<br
/>
<span class="smcap">Thomas Evans</span>,<br />

<p>Here lies the decoy man, who lived like an otter,<br />
Dividing his time betwixt land and water.<br />
His hide he oft soaked in the waters of Perry,<br />
Whilst Aston old beer his spirits kept cherry.<br />
Amphibious his trim, death was puzzled they say<br />
How to dust to reduce such well moistened clay,<br />
So death turned decoy man, and decoyed him to land,<br />
Where he fixed his abode till quite dried to the hand.<br />
He then found him fitting for crumbling to dust,<br />
So here he lies mouldering, as you and I must.</p>

<p>In this lovely village, we put up at a small inn, the Crown,
to take luncheon, which was <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>served with much civility&mdash;cold
meat, a cream salad, and a capital Cheshire cheese, with the very
best of Shropshire ale.&nbsp; The name of the host I have
forgotten, but it is the first inn on the left on entering the
village from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; It has a delightful garden
attached to it, with grottos and arbours; roses and woodbines
distribute their fragrance in prodigal gratuity, and the <i>tout
ensemble</i> gives an admirable idea of fairy land.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A <span class="smcap">pleasant</span> walk of six miles
brought us to Chirk; agreeably situated upon the northern bank of
the river Ceriog, which divides England <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>from
Wales.&nbsp; The village church is dedicated to St. Mary, and is
an impropriation belonging to Valle Crucis Abbey, and contains
some monuments erected to the memory of the members of the Chirk
families.&nbsp; The most interesting is that of the famous Sir
Thomas Myddleton.&nbsp; The church-yard is planted with yew
trees, and the Hand Inn is a very comfortable house of
entertainment.</p>
<p>The aqueduct is the great <i>lion</i> of this place;
consisting of ten arches, the piers of which are sixty-five feet
high.&nbsp; The Ellesmere canal is continued across the valley by
this beautiful specimen of art, then enters a tunnel 220 yards
long; emerging from which it proceeds on its course through the
parish, and then enters another tunnel, which having traversed,
its waters are transported over the vale of the Dee by the
stupendous aqueduct of Pont-y-Cysylltau.&nbsp; The village of
Chirk is seven miles from Llangollen, and five from Oswestry,
from Knaton six, and from London 171.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon this spot,&rdquo; said my amusing companion,
&ldquo;a legend was repeated to me, which I thought rather
amusing; and, as you say you are a collector of strange stories,
I will relate it <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>to you as we pass along, with as much accuracy as my
memory will permit.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE DESERTED.</h3>
<p>Mary Griffith was a tall, raw-boned, bouncing girl, whose skin
had felt the influence of nineteen summers: with red ropy hair,
which fell in mop-like luxuriance about her face and back,
partially hiding two gooseberry eyes, that looked, or seemed to
look, in opposite directions.&nbsp; Roger ap Morgan was a stout,
sturdy, hard-working peasant: and once, while under the influence
of his master&rsquo;s strong harvest ale, bestowed on Mary such
tender melting words, as had never before been addressed to her
beauty, and which her unaccustomed ear drank with astonishment
and delight.&nbsp; She greedily banqueted on the honey of his
tongue, and in short was never so pleased in her life before.</p>
<p>It was remarked, that from this night Mary and Roger were more
intimate than ever; and they were therefore looked upon as a
couple shortly to be united in the bands of matrimony.</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>Mary&rsquo;s charms, however, were not of a nature to be
unappreciated by others; and Roger&rsquo;s friends were
exceedingly forward in praising her various perfections, and more
especially the beauty of her eyes and face, and the silky
softness of her auburn hair, three fibres of which were
sufficient to have made an exceeding good twine of tolerable
strength.</p>
<p>Roger bore all these bursts of admiration without the
slightest tinge of jealousy, and even sometimes, with a good
humoured laugh, joined in the jests of his companions.&nbsp; But
there is such a thing as over fondness in adoring woman: and
Roger began to discover, that if Mary would only love him half as
much as she did, he might perhaps have a far greater liking for
her than he had; but unfortunately Mary knew no measure in her
love.&nbsp; She vowed he should marry her; Roger swore heartily
he would not.&nbsp; At length, it became apparent that Mary had
yielded up not only her heart but her honour, also, to the too
insidious and fascinating Roger.&nbsp; His ingratitude, in
refusing to keep his word, and make an honest woman of her, sank
deep into her heart.&nbsp; She resolved, however, not to let him
off so easily; and determined, if he persisted in denying <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>his person,
she would at least have some of his goods and chattels.</p>
<p>At this period, a number of baronial laws, although dormant,
might still be enforced on occasion, and amongst them was one
which furnished Mary with a promising prospect of
recompense.&nbsp; It decreed, that in cases of seduction, the
injured fair, on making application to the presiding magistrate,
was entitled to remuneration by submitting to the following
ordeal:&mdash;The tail of a three years old bull, the property of
the seducer, being well shaven, greased and introduced through a
wicker door, if the applicant could, by so treacherous a handle,
detain the animal for a certain period with both hands, while two
men goaded it to escape, it became hers, by right of conquest, in
satisfaction for her lost virtue; and, in case of failure, she
forfeited all further claim, and was rewarded for her attempt
with so much of the grease and soap as remained in her hands.</p>
<p>Women know no medium in the master-passion: &ldquo;Where most
they love, there most they hate when slighted:&rdquo;&mdash;and
so with Molly.&nbsp; All nature seemed to change: the beautiful
valley no longer heard the soft murmurings of Roger&rsquo;s <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>&ldquo;love
breathed vows;&rdquo; the waters of the Ceriog flowed on without
a rival sound; and Molly vowed vengeance amid their peaceful
banks, where once she swore eternal love and constancy.</p>
<p>One morning after a long expostulation, with her inconstant,
she summoned him before the magistrate of the district, and,
accompanied by her friends, demanded the ordeal, which was the
right, from time immemorial, of the victims of seduction and
desertion.&nbsp; The magistrate, being a lover of old laws and
customs, and also somewhat of a humorist, readily acceded to her
wishes, and the following morning was appointed for the
accomplishment of her vengeance, verifying the Welsh
proverb&mdash;&ldquo;Gnawd rhygas wedi rhysere.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Common is extreme hate after extreme fondness.</p>
<p>This was woful intelligence for Roger, whose farming stock
consisted of an only cow, which was sentenced to be substituted
for the <i>bull</i>, which the original act specified should be
liable to confiscation.&nbsp; This cow was the chief source of
his livelihood; her butter furnished him with the means of
procuring clothes, and other necessaries, and the skimmed milk, a
pleasant beverage <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>to wash down his vegetable fare&mdash;for animal food
was a stranger to the table of Roger, as it was indeed to almost
all the peasantry of the country, except upon days of rejoicing,
viz. marriages and funerals, when friends and relations clubbed
together to furnish a sumptuous meal for the assembled
guests.&nbsp; Still, however, he resolved to hazard this severe
loss, rather than be encumbered with a wife, whose industry and
affection were but a poor compensation for the defects of her
person and conversation.</p>
<p>On the following day, the peaceful inhabitants of this lovely
spot were startled from their various occupations by a loud shout
which issued from the thick woods of the vale, and then</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There rose so wild a yell<br />
From out yon dark and hollow dell,<br />
As all the fiends from heaven that fell<br />
Had pealed the banner cry of hell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The clamour was raised by the revilings of Roger&rsquo;s
friends against Mary, and Mary&rsquo;s friends against Roger, as
the object of interest (Roger&rsquo;s cow) approached the
dwelling of the deceived and neglected fair one, who mounted
astride upon its back, turned her fierce glances or <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>benignant
smiles, upon her enemies or friends, as they alternately hooted
and hurrahed her.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s mother, an ancient gammer, whose sun-tanned skin
seemed, as Shakspeare has it, capable of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Keeping out water a long while,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>armed with a branch of tough ash, was urging the progress of
the beast, and at every push she made, a yell of indignation
burst from the opposite party, which was answered by a shout of
exultation from the friends of Mary.&nbsp; At length the barber,
one Gryffyd, was called on to lend his aid, which he did, in a
masterly manner by lathering, and shaving the beast&rsquo;s tail
of every hair that adorned it, from the insertion to the tuft,
and afterwards greasing and soaping it thoroughly.&nbsp; Mary
eyed it, meanwhile, as though she longed to convert it into
soup.</p>
<p>These preparations being completed, Mary addressed her
false-hearted swain, and even then, generously offered to give up
the chance if he would repent and make her an honest woman.&nbsp;
This noble proposition excited murmurs of applause.&nbsp; <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>But all in
vain,&mdash;Roger remained inexorable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then may I never be married,&rdquo; cried she,
&ldquo;if ever you take your cow home again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s yet to be tried,&rdquo; cried Roger.</p>
<p>Molly then bared her brawny arms, and held up her ten
fingers&mdash;as much as to say, &ldquo;Let her escape my grip if
she can!&rdquo;&mdash;and, with a countenance flashing anger and
resolution, she took her station at the wicket, &ldquo;screwed up
to the sticking point,&rdquo; and resolved to &ldquo;stand the
hazard of the die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the grasp of a vice, she seized the pendant ornament; and
now it was pull cow, pull Molly!&mdash;for the two sturdy
brothers of Roger belaboured the animal most unmercifully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your own!&rdquo; shrieked Mary&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, you old devil!&rdquo; cried the brothers of
Roger, as they thrashed and goaded the poor cow.&nbsp; Still with
heroic firmness Mary kept her hold.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But who can rule the uncertain chance of
war?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The period of detention had nearly arrived;&mdash;half a
minute more, and Mary would be victorious&mdash;her vengeance
complete&mdash;and Roger quite undone!&mdash;when lo! the
tortured animal leaped <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>suddenly from the wicket&mdash;and
Mary, wretched Mary!&mdash;fell upon her brawny back, with the
cow&rsquo;s tail extended in her hands!&mdash;&rsquo;Twas all the
spoil her valiant attempt had left her!&mdash;Twisting and
capering, the beast was seen speeding its way to Roger&rsquo;s
well known home;&mdash;and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus was she (poor Molly)!<br />
Of cow, of virtue, everything, bereft.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was rumoured that foul play had been committed by
Roger&rsquo;s brothers; and that a stick, with a sharp instrument
at the end of it, had caused the catastrophe;&mdash;but, as there
was no means of ascertaining the fact, the affair dropped.</p>
<p>A rustic bard, who had been hospitably received in
Mary&rsquo;s dwelling, presented to her the following Lament,
which he composed, in gratitude, for her consolation.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">LAMENT.</p>
<p>Oh mournful day! oh mournful day!<br />
Base Roger&rsquo;s cow has run away,<br />
And left poor Molly to bewail<br />
The sorrows she cannot <i>re-tail</i>.</p>
<p>The grateful cabbage, greens, and leek<br />
Her hands have reared, could they but speak,<br />
<a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Would thus
hold converse with the ground,<br />
Which daily her attention found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mother earth, how hard you get,<br />
Since Molly&rsquo;s left to pine and fret;<br />
You drain our tops, our bottoms pinch,<br />
We cannot grow another inch!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bed, so lately soft and warm,<br />
To stony hardness you transform;<br />
If &rsquo;tis for Molly this you do,<br />
Oh think of leek and cabbage too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; then said mother earth,<br />
&ldquo;I ever loved ye from your birth;<br />
But know that I, as well as you,<br />
Am doomed to pine and suffer too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if your bottoms feel uneasy,<br />
&rsquo;Tis not from want of will to please ye;<br />
And if your green tops droop and pine,<br />
&rsquo;Tis not from any fault of mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I am thirsting for a sup,<br />
And Molly never stirs me up.<br />
Forsaken love hath made her sore&mdash;<br />
She cultivates the ground no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh mournful day! oh mournful day!<br />
Base Roger&rsquo;s cow has run away,<br />
And left poor Molly to bewail<br />
The sorrows she cannot <i>re-tail</i>!</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After proceeding about a mile and a half on the Llangollen
road, we turned off, to the left, up <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>a lane, which led us to the noble
domain of Mrs. Middleton Biddulph.</p>
<h3>CHIRK CASTLE</h3>
<p>Is delightfully situated on the spacious domain, spreading
over the summit of, what would be deemed, by a southern, a lofty
mountain, but which is here only designated a hill, projecting
from the range of Berwyn mountains; and is well calculated to
recall the stories of the days of old, when flourished</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The good old rule, the
simple plan,<br />
That they should take who have the power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they should keep who can.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p68b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Chirk Castle"
title=
"Chirk Castle"
 src="images/p68s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>It is built of solid stone; and the ivy, mantling over the
walls, gives them an appearance of solemnity and grandeur,
peculiarly interesting.&nbsp; It is quadrangular, and is
strengthened by five massive towers, one at each corner, and the
fifth projecting from the principal front, through which is a
lofty entrance into the court-yard, 165 feet in length, and 100
feet in breadth, surrounded on every side by noble suites of
apartments.&nbsp; The picture gallery measures 100 feet in
length, by twenty-two in breadth; and contains some very
excellent paintings, and several <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>portraits of the Middleton
family.&nbsp; Amongst the latter is that of Sir Thomas Middleton,
who defended himself gallantly against the forces of Cromwell,
and was rewarded for his loyalty by Charles II, who granted him
&pound;30,000 for the loss he had sustained, besides many
valuable presents; amongst others, a cabinet, which is shewn in
the gallery, valued at &pound;7,000, richly ornamented with
silver; in various compartments of which are paintings, said to
have been executed by Rubens.&nbsp; The monarch offered to
elevate Sir Thomas to the peerage, which he declined.</p>
<p>The walls of the castle are eighteen feet in thickness; but
sleeping and other apartments have been cut into them, for the
accommodation of the family.</p>
<p>The celebrated picture of Pystil Rhaidar, in the dining-room,
shows that noble waterfall tumbling into the <i>sea</i>, <i>where
several ships are quietly riding at anchor</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pystil Rhaidar,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;The spout of the
Cataract,&rdquo; is considered the largest fall in Wales.&nbsp;
In the valley of Mochnant, about four miles from the village, the
river falls over an almost perpendicular rock, 240 feet high;
thence rushing furiously under a natural arch towards the bottom,
it plunges into a deep black pool, overhung with impervious
shaggy wood.</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>The
story of the artist&rsquo;s introducing the ocean with ships, is
rather curious.&nbsp; He was a foreigner, and but little
acquainted with the English language; and when he had completed
the picture, one of the persons to whom it was first shown
observed, that &ldquo;a few <i>sheep</i> placed near the foot of
the fall would be a great improvement.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Misunderstanding <i>sheep</i> for <i>ship</i>, his amazement was
extreme.&nbsp; He, however, took the picture to his easel, and
introduced <i>ships</i> with the necessary element to float
them!&nbsp; A mistake so humorous determined the purchaser to
allow of no further alteration.</p>
<p>The present building was completed in two years.&nbsp; The
first stone being laid in the year 1011, and in 1013 the castle
frowned defiance to the foe.</p>
<p>It was built by Roger Mortimer, Earl of Wigmore, as a
stronghold to defend him from the just vengeance he had created
by the murder of the sons of Gryffydd ap Madoc, to whom he was
appointed guardian, in conjunction with John, Earl of Warren, in
the hope of inheriting their joint estates.&nbsp; Mortimer was to
seize upon Nanheuddwg and Chirk, the property of the youngest;
and Warren upon the lands of Broomfield, Yale, and Dinas Bran,
belonging to the eldest.&nbsp; Travellers should not neglect to
visit this noble specimen of warlike architecture.&nbsp; Its <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>picture
gallery and dungeon will, in their different styles, excite
admiration.</p>
<p>On the foundation of the present castle anciently stood Castle
Crogen; and the territory around bore the name of Tref-y-Waun,
the property of the lords of Dinas Bran, and continued in their
possession up to the death of Gryffydd ap Madoc, in the reign of
Edward the First.</p>
<p>The view from the highlands of the park is very extensive,
commanding a prospect of seventeen different counties.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The ground upon which we now stand,&rdquo; said my
companion, &ldquo;is remarkable for a melancholy circumstance,
which caused much grief and sorrow in the castle and its
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The story of Owen-ap-Mylton and Mary Fuller
will perhaps interest you, as it gave a name to this part of the
estate, which it still retains, &lsquo;The Black
Park.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE ENCHANTED STAG.</h3>
<p>In a poor hut, which formerly stood upon the site of a few
cottages, upon the right of the lane leading to the castle from
the high road, lived an aged woman, who kept no society, and was
considered, from her reserved <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>habits, drooping gait, and
smoke-dried visage, to have strange dealings with the Evil One;
and upon whom the neighbours looked with fear and trembling,
whenever they met her in the evening twilight, or when</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash; the morn in russet mantle clad,<br
/>
<i>Walk&rsquo;d</i> o&rsquo;er the dew of yon high eastern
hill.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her patch of ground she cultivated without help from any; and
no one knew by what means she obtained clothing, as her garden
stock only consisted of a few eatables, which she could ill
afford to part with for wool to supply her spinning wheel; and
yet her hose were good and clean, and her woollen petticoat and
russet gown well fitted to endure the weather&rsquo;s
extremes.&nbsp; Strange stories were, however, reported
respecting her, as it was said she had come from the
Devil&rsquo;s Peak in Derbyshire, where she had the credit of
being a witch, and was nearly apprehended, upon a special order
from King James himself, by the officers of justice, who, when
they would have laid hands upon her, were astonished to find that
they had seized each other, she having vanished suddenly from
betwixt them, and, on the same day, it was said, appeared at
Chirk Castle, offering to pay a half <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>year&rsquo;s rent in advance for the
little hut, which was then to let, by the hedge-side in the lane,
and which the steward accepted.&nbsp; She regularly, afterwards
paid in advance; but none could tell how she came by the money,
and the gossips reviled her as a limb of the Devil.&nbsp; This
absurd notion obtained for her the odium of having performed a
principal part in the following simple and melancholy tale.</p>
<p>Owen, the ranger, was a tall, handsome, light-hearted,
well-meaning lad, as any in the country, much esteemed amongst
his associates, and admired by all the lasses from Chirk to
Llangollen, from whom he had selected Mary Fuller for his bride,
a blue-eyed, flaxen-haired, pretty lass, who lived as servant in
the castle.</p>
<p>Owen&rsquo;s cottage, situated where now stands a handsome
house, was a neat building, consisting of four rooms; it was
thatched, and the interior was adorned with implements of the
chase.&nbsp; It commanded a pleasant and romantic prospect; the
view down the valley being extremely picturesque.&nbsp; Upon the
trunk of an elm tree, the stump of which is almost all that time
has spared, are still to be traced, although faintly discernible,
the widely expanded initials, O. M. and M. F. which in former
days were doubtless deeply cut in its bark.&nbsp; It was the
favourite tree of Owen <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>and Mary; and beneath its spreading
branches they used to sit many a moonlight evening, and whisper
rustic vows of constancy and truth.</p>
<p>One night, as they were walking, with arms clasped round each
other&rsquo;s waist, near the hut of the old strange woman, they
were surprised at beholding her patting a noble stag, which had
strayed from the park, and which seemed fond of his new
acquaintance, for it licked her face and capered before her, and
put its mouth close to her ear, while she continued to pat him
with her hand, and speak to him in a language totally unknown to
the peasantry.&nbsp; Owen, enraged at seeing one whom he
considered a witch, seducing one of his noblest stags from the
park, raised his cross-bow and shook his head at her, as if to
intimate that he would shoot her, should she dare to fondle the
deer again.&nbsp; The old beldame, frightened at his looks and
gestures, retreated into her hut, but shook her hand at him in a
threatening manner; while the stag, bounding suddenly from her
door, made towards the park, like lightning, and leaping the high
fence, began to browze as usual on its native pasture.&nbsp; Mary
noticed the look and threatening action of the old woman with
fear, and for sometime they continued their walk in silence,
neither being anxious to <i>speak</i> upon the subject, but both
unable <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>to
<i>think</i> of any thing else.&nbsp; At length, when they
reached the bottom of the lane, and turned into the high road
(which at this period was rough and only used by horsemen and
foot passengers who were dreadfully inconvenienced by the state
it was suffered to remain in), the cloud that hung over their
spirits began to disperse itself, and Owen, eager to resume the
theme which the appearance of the old woman had interrupted,
again spoke of their approaching marriage and the proposed
arrangements he had formed.&nbsp; Mary listened with attention,
for only one day was to intervene before the happy morning was to
open on their joys.</p>
<p>Owen informed her that his master had promised him the finest
buck he could kill in the park, and a couple of barrels of his
old October, to regale his friends and guests; he had likewise,
he said, presented him with a new bed and furniture, fit for a
baron to lie upon, and large enough for six to sleep in!&nbsp;
Mary was happy, and Owen more animated, as he spoke of the bounty
of his gracious master.&nbsp; Mary, eager to enumerate the
presents she had received, began the catalogue of articles
necessary for their domestic economy and comfort, and had nearly
ran through the names of fifty by the time they arrived at her
cottage door, which was the signal <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>for parting, and with many a kiss and
promise of meeting again early in the morning, the lovers
separated.</p>
<p>Owen went whistling along the road with a light heart, in fond
anticipation of future felicity, when suddenly, as he turned into
the dark lane, upon his way to his own lodge, he was startled by
the appearance of a dark form, with glaring eyes of fire,
squatted upon the trunk of an old alder tree, that had been
blasted by the lightning a few days before; and an unearthly
<i>mew</i>! broke from its lips; and it spat a quantity of saliva
in his face.&nbsp; Hot, hot, and burning, seemed the filthy
rheum!&nbsp; A low growl increased his terrors; and a wild squall
gave him the speed of a deer, as he darted along the dark and
narrow lane, his hair standing on end.&nbsp; When he had reached
the solitary&rsquo;s door, he saw her seated by her iron pot,
stirring the contents with the handle of a broom, while the glare
from the crackling fagot shot frequent but transient streams of
light upon her time-worn visage.&nbsp; Being now more convinced
than ever that sorcery was at work, he redoubled his speed, and
heated with fright and fear, reached his welcome home, where he
sank breathless into a chair in the chimney corner.</p>
<p>Strange dreams afflicted him during the night; and he arose at
daybreak feverish and unrefreshed.&nbsp; <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>The usual
summons at the door was given by his fellow ranger, who, upon
being admitted, presented him with a venison pasty, on which he
felt his courage and appetite rapidly returning.&nbsp; A second
friend brought a flagon of wine from the kind rector of the
village; a third brought a quarter of mountain lamb; a fourth the
haunch of a well fatted kid; and many other tokens of kindness
from his neighbours entirely banished the memory of the
disagreeables of the preceding night, and universal smiles and
congratulations ushered in the merry morning.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s friends, meanwhile, were no less anxious to
evince their regard for her; and presents poured in from all
parts of the neighbourhood, from warm hearted and considerate
well-wishers relations and acquaintances, in consideration of the
happy morrow which was to unite two beings universally respected
and beloved.&nbsp; There was a happy congregation in the valley
of Chirk, upon the evening previous to the appointed bridal
morn.&nbsp; The minstrel struck up his liveliest notes; the
maidens danced joyfully; and even grand-sires and their dames
exerted themselves in the dance, evincing that though time had
somewhat burthened their bodies, their &ldquo;hearts were all
light and merry.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Evening
at length drew near to a close, and the shadows of the mountains
spreading over the peaceful valley, gave signal to depart.&nbsp;
It was pleasing to listen to the distant and retiring notes of
the minstrel&rsquo;s harp, and the hum of laughter, echoed from
the beetling cliff and dying in the gorge of the Ceriog
valley.&nbsp; Sometimes the wild halloo of the mountaineer was
heard shouting above the heads of those beneath; until at length
only two persons stood upon the sloping sides of the castle hill,
with fixed attention, looking in each others face, and with arms
entwined around their youthful forms.</p>
<p>There are few who have not felt the power of love: but very
few perhaps have stood as these two stood, upon the slope of a
dark mountain rock, listening to the parting accents of their
friends as they subsided into silence, while beneath them roared
the never quiet-waters, brawling through rocky fragments, and
shaking the wild tangled shrubs that grew upon their banks; with
limpid kisses pure and fresh.&nbsp; And there they paused, and
looked, and sighed, and loved, and murmured sweet words of
anticipated happiness; when suddenly the sky, serene before, was
overcast with clouds, and the wind rushed by them with a fury
powerful as unexpected.&nbsp; The night grew darker and darker,
and they were <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>nearly half a league from Mary&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; They
cautiously pursued their way through the dew-dripping heather,
when presently a light appeared on the opposite side of the
valley; and shadowy forms were distinctly seen moving behind it
in slow procession.&nbsp; They had reached the spot where the
aqueduct now crosses the vale, within a short distance of
Mary&rsquo;s dwelling, but terror prevented them from moving,
while the procession with the corpse-light at its head, glided
along without a sound, becoming more distinct as it approached
within a hundred paces of the spot where the terrified lovers
stood almost breathless.&nbsp; Four shadowy, headless figures
followed the light, and were succeeded by a hearse, which moved
without the aid of horses or creature of any kind to draw or
propel it forward, upon which lay extended the form of a man,
bloody, as newly slain.&nbsp; Owen fancied he saw a resemblance
of himself in that bloody corpse, and the increasing weight of
Mary upon his arm, assured him she had likewise recognised the
likeness, for she had fainted.&nbsp; With eyes that almost burst
from their sockets, he continued to gaze on, and saw, or thought
he saw, many of his kind friends weeping, in the long train that
followed.&nbsp; The corpse-light still advanced, and he
distinctly saw it leading towards the churchyard <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>of the
village, where it vanished amongst the old yew trees, and with it
the phantoms that made up the procession.</p>
<p>Owen bore his senseless burthen to the cottage, where he
acquainted her mother that a sudden fright had caused her to be
thus overcome, desiring that she should be put to bed upon the
instant, and that when she recovered she might be persuaded, what
she had seen was merely the illusion of a dream; and he quitted
the cottage with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>The night was a sleepless one both to Mary and to her lover;
but with the rising beams of the morning their gloom dispersed;
and, as the rays gilded the mountain tops, they were both up, and
waiting for the numerous friends of both sexes, that usually, on
such occasions, are anxious to be foremost in paying their
salutations.&nbsp; The bride&rsquo;s cottage being of the
smallest class, Owen&rsquo;s was agreed upon to be the place of
rendezvous, and a plentiful store of viands was ready for the
guests to partake of at an early hour.&nbsp; The gay friends of
the preceding evening were seen decorated in their holiday
garments, fresh and fair as the cool breeze and the sweetest wild
flowers of their native hills, clustering together before their
cottages, and tripping in various groups towards Owen&rsquo;s
pleasant dwelling.&nbsp; <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning
was the time appointed for the ceremony to take place in the
little church of Chirk, and all were eager to attend the young
couple, and&mdash;to eat their breakfast, which on such occasions
was far from frugal.&nbsp; Owen&rsquo;s relatives were all ready
mounted at his door, prepared for the wedding hunt, and, when he
joined them, away they galloped towards the cottage of
Mary.&nbsp; She was seated upon her favourite Merlin, surrounded
by her friends, who set up a shout as Owen and his party came in
sight.&nbsp; The bridegroom having arrived, and made his claim to
Mary, he was refused; and then a mock fight took place between
the parties, and sundry thwacks upon the head were given and
received in sport.&nbsp; At length, the bride and her kinsmen
started off at full speed in the direction of Chirk Castle.&nbsp;
The bridegroom following, worse mounted, but eager in the
pursuit, shouting for them to stop; until at last the flying
party having reached the park, they permitted Owen to overtake
them, according to the custom, who then led his bride to the
cottage, where everything was in readiness for their
reception.</p>
<p>The bride, habited in a snow white dress, with some white
heath flowers bound in her braided hair, was the admiration of
all.&nbsp; Owen in his new suit, made for the occasion, looked
handsomer <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>than ever.&nbsp; They danced together upon the new mown
grass, while Jordan, the minstrel, played his blithest
tunes.&nbsp; At length, the party sat down to the repast, and
rustic jests were given and returned with glee and good humour;
when suddenly, the bridegroom being called aside, Mary took that
opportunity to steal away, meaning to run off to the church, and
laugh at Owen&rsquo;s and his friend&rsquo;s perplexity at her
absence, and their astonishment at finding her at the church
porch before them.</p>
<p>She was soon missed; and, suspecting it was a trick to perplex
them, away the whole party ran in different directions in search
of the runaway.</p>
<p>Mary had nearly arrived at the old woman&rsquo;s cottage when
Owen descried her.&nbsp; He had not forgotten the scene of the
preceding night, and his heart had some painful misgivings that
all was not right when he first missed his bride so suddenly from
the breakfast table.&nbsp; Owen shouted and shouted! but the more
he exercised his lungs, the faster she made use of her heels,
when suddenly the &ldquo;stag of six,&rdquo; which he had seen
the night before, darted from the old woman&rsquo;s cottage, and
ran furiously at Mary, who turned round and retraced her steps
with fear and terror, but with the speed of the wind.&nbsp; She
<a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>flew past
Owen, who endeavoured to stop the deer, but all in vain.&nbsp;
The interposing trees at times prevented the animal from
pursuing, by entangling his branches with the lower boughs; but
these impediments seemed only to redouble his fury when he again
released himself, and Owen had not yet come up with him, though
Mary kept the lead.&nbsp; Other friends now joined in the attempt
to drive the creature in another direction, and with hands joined
they formed a barrier, shouting and hallooing to frighten the
stag as he approached the park; but all in vain; he bounded on
more furiously than before, scattering the crowd in every
direction.&nbsp; Owen at length overtook the furious stag, and
was just in time to succour Mary.&nbsp; His coat, which he had
taken off in the race, he dexterously managed to fling over the
antlers of the brute, which, falling over its eyes, for a minute
confounded the deer, and taking his Mary by the arm, he hurried
her away in the direction of the cottage, but not in time to
elude the pursuit of the infuriated animal, which having shaken
off the blind followed them at full speed.&nbsp; Owen had no
means of defence; the stag approached rapidly; he bade Mary
continue her speed and reach the cottage, and then, with
desperate valour, <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>awaited the attack; in an instant after, he had grasped
the horns and was dashed to the ground with violence: he rose
again and with a bound leaped upon its back.&nbsp; The creature
flung his antlers back, whirled round and round, but still Owen
sat immoveable, and new hopes arose in the breasts of his
friends, who gathered near and hemmed them round, when suddenly
the beast rushed sideways against the trunk of a huge oak, and
violently fractured Owen&rsquo;s leg; but with persevering
bravery he still kept his seat.&nbsp; At length, unable to rid
itself of its burthen, the creature rolled upon the earth, and in
the fall Owen&rsquo;s right arm was shattered, and his foe once
again free.&nbsp; It reared and placed its fore feet on the chest
of Owen; and, as he raised himself once more to grapple with his
enemy, its pointed antlers struck into his heart, and with a
groan he instantly expired, while the fierce animal took to the
mountains, and was seen no more.</p>
<p>Mary, who had entered the cottage of the ranger, in the midst
of her terrors spoke of the old woman, who she said had bewitched
the stag;&mdash;but, when her friends reached the door of the
hut, and found they could not, by knocking, obtain admission,
they broke it open, and found its inmate dead upon the
floor.&nbsp; Rumour said that she had infused her spirit into the
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>deer to
revenge the threats of Owen on the preceding night; and her
remains were treated with a ferocity which it would be as painful
to listen to as to narrate.</p>
<p>Poor Mary never recovered from the shock; and in a few weeks
after the mangled remains of her lover were deposited in the
church yard of Chirk, the fresh flowers and evergreens were also
placed around <i>her</i> grave.</p>
<p>For many years this tribute of friendship was regularly paid
to their memories.&nbsp; In summer, flowers of the sweetest
perfume breathed their dying odours around their graves, and, in
winter, the holly and laurel spread their shining leaves to adorn
their final resting place.&nbsp; Time, however, took away by
degrees, the kind friends of the ill fated lovers, and no sign
now points out the spot where, side by side, they slumber.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We now got once more into the coach road, and pushed on for
Llangollen, leaving Wynstay, the seat of Sir Watkin William Wynn,
upon the right.&nbsp; Almost every guide book will furnish the
tourist with a description of this costly mansion and its
beautiful grounds; but the wild scenery of nature, and the ruins
of former grandeur, which yield an inexhaustible fund for
contemplation and delight, together with the wild legends <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>of the
peasant or wandering minstrel, which render every spot you tread
upon in this country enchanted ground, are more congenial to the
feelings of the writer of this little work than all the gorgeous
display of modern art and luxury.&nbsp; Therefore Wynstay, with
Eaton Hall, the magnificent residence of the Marquis of
Westminster, he resigns to those whose tastes are more refined
(by luxury) to describe.</p>
<p>Leaving Wynstay on the right, we were conducted along the
banks of a beautiful canal (the same that crossed the valley at
Chirk) which was here planted with larch and hazel in pleasing
variety on either side.&nbsp; On a sudden, an opening in the
foliage presented us with a splendid view of the vale of the Dee,
with the grand aqueduct stretching from hill to hill and the
waters of the river making their way among broken rocks, amid
embowering trees, and rolling under the arches of the aqueduct,
with that delightful sound which is only heard in mountain
scenery.</p>
<p>Seldom had I experienced so delightful a sensation as the
present prospect occasioned.&nbsp; All was so calm, so quiet, it
seemed indeed &ldquo;the happy valley.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shortly
after, however, we found that no golden pleasure is entirely free
from alloy, for on turning a projection upon the <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>road, we were
nearly stifled by the smoke from a lime furnace, and what was
worse, &ldquo;another and another still succeeded,&rdquo;
resembling a line of batteries blazing and vomiting forth smoke
and destruction, while on the opposite mountain an uniform body
of iron works were firing away from their tall chimneys, and
steadily maintaining the never ceasing conflict.</p>
<p>At length, however, having happily passed these belligerents,
my companion led me in triumph into a little public house on the
road side, (which overlooked a precipice) <i>the Aqueduct
Tavern</i>, the exterior of which promised little better
accommodation than is to be met with in an Irish cabin.&nbsp; We
entered, nevertheless, and, although the floor was of brick, it
was very clean and the household utensils glittered along the
walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, gentlemen, walk into the back parlour,&rdquo;
said a comely looking, good natured landlady of about
forty-three.</p>
<p>We gladly accepted her invitation, and were agreeably
surprised to find a neat room, carpeted, with a sofa, and half a
dozen hair-bottomed chairs, and every thing rurally
comfortable.&nbsp; The window looked upon the aqueduct, and
commanded a beautiful view.</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Here I
became musical, and hummed &ldquo;the woodpecker tapping,&rdquo;
to the no small annoyance of my companion, who had stretched
himself upon the sofa with the intention, doubtless, of taking a
nap after his long walk.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And I said, if there&rsquo;s peace to be
found in the world,<br />
The heart that is humble might hope for it here.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And here will I take up my quarters for the
night.&nbsp; A glass of gin and water, cold and weak, if you
please, Mrs. &mdash;, for I am thirsty.&nbsp; Very good,
indeed;&mdash;now, a sheet of paper, to take down my notes of the
day&rsquo;s ramble.&nbsp; Very good again, Mrs. &mdash;, and now
if you have good beds you may get us a lamb chop, with some tea,
etc. etc. and leave us to enjoy this lovely prospect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No beds, I am sorry to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No beds, Mrs. &mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I hope to get some by next summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why then, Mrs. &mdash;, I am afraid we shall have to
proceed to the village.&nbsp; How far is Llangollen from
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six miles, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>&ldquo;Just six o&rsquo;clock, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then bring in two screeching hot tumblers of punch,
there&rsquo;s a good lady, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let us take the road.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the trumpet of my companion began to sound; but I thought
it would be advisable for him to rise before he became too stiff
to resume his walk; therefore, with &ldquo;yoicks! yoicks!&rdquo;
I startled the heavy god from his eyelids, and informed him of
our unfortunate situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters but little,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;there is
sufficient upon the road to interest us, and perhaps the twilight
of such an evening as this is preferable to the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having discussed our punch and lighted our cigars, we quitted
the comfortable little cottage, and bent our steps towards the
aqueduct, intending to cross by it to the opposite side of the
vale.</p>
<p>A cigar in the cool of the evening is delightful.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Glorious tobacco, that from east to west<br
/>
Cheers the tar&rsquo;s labour, and the Turk-man&rsquo;s
rest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So sang the Noble Bard, the music of whose lyre <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>is left to
charm the race of mankind for ages yet to come.</p>
<p>We soon reached the centre of the aqueduct; it extends from
mountain to mountain in length 980 feet; it is sustained by
twenty piers, 116 feet in height from the bed of the river Dee,
and the span of the arches is forty-five feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you observe yon house?&rdquo; inquired my companion,
with a grave air, pointing to a building which seemed to have
belonged to some opulent person in times gone by, although it was
now in a state of decay.&nbsp; Having replied in the affirmative,
he proceeded:&mdash;&ldquo;In that house lived a creature who was
called &lsquo;the Pride of the Valley.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was the
daughter of a rich merchant of Bristol, and was beloved by a poor
but honest and well-educated youth, who was, and has been since,
a wanderer from his birth.&nbsp; Her christian name was Eveleen;
no matter for her father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The following verses were
written upon her untimely fate:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the days of my boyhood, when pleasures
pass&rsquo;d by,<br />
Like the fragrance of flowers on morning&rsquo;s first sigh,<br
/>
In the vale of Llangollen there dwelt a fair rose<br />
More lovely than daybreak, and sweet as its close.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her step was
light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As fays by
night:<br />
More thrilling her voice than the streamlet that flows<br />
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>And mild
as the moonlight and blue as the sky<br />
Was the beam and the colour of Eveleen&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Eveleen&rsquo;s friends were of wealthy degree,<br
/>
And tyranny forced her to cross the wide sea.<br />
She faded, alas! as she drooped o&rsquo;er the wave,<br />
And died! but no blossom was strewed on her grave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The waters
deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll o&rsquo;er
her sleep,<br />
And sea-stars now light up her billowy cave;<br />
The winds moan above her, and Peris deplore<br />
Round the rose of Llangollen, which charms us no more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;She was ordered to the Indies,&rdquo; he said, vainly
endeavouring to hide a tear, which told me the secret of his
heart.&nbsp; I know not how it is, love tales are generally a
great bore to the listener, but there was something so true, so
heartfelt, in that single drop which glistened in the eye of my
companion, that if delicacy would have permitted me, I should
certainly have taxed him as being the hero of his own tale, and
have requested him to give me a more minute relation of the
affair.</p>
<p>I never felt the influence of the sublime mingled with the
beautiful so deeply as when I stood upon this wonderful work of
art; wherever I turned my eyes, the scene was calculated to
excite the warmest feelings of admiration.&nbsp; The <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Dee flowing
beneath, shadowed by the rich tints of the summer foliage; the
ruined bridge; the dark mountain masses upon either side, patched
with gloomy pines, intermingled with the relieving brightness of
the graceful larch;&mdash;here tracing the lovely blooming
heather, there the blasted rock in its naked majesty, and the
noble amphitheatre at the extremity of the vale, with a view of
the beautiful stream, as it came winding from the opposite
point&mdash;the twittering of the birds as they prepared their
mossy nests for repose, gave a charm to the evening, which can
only be felt while witnessing the scene, and exceeds the power of
description.</p>
<p>Having crossed the aqueduct, we proceeded by the left bank of
the canal, passing a forge that nearly stifled us with gaseous
smoke, along a pathway made of cinders and small coal, the refuse
of the foundry.&nbsp; Trees of every description hung over our
heads, and sloped down a deep declivity to the margin of the Dee,
while on the opposite bank the mountain frowned above us.&nbsp;
The partial glances we obtained of the vale through the woods,
discovered scenes which the artist&rsquo;s fancy might vainly
attempt to equal.&nbsp; The water-flies, darting along the
surface of the canal, and leaving long streaks of light <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>behind them
in myriad flashes, likewise engaged our attention; and we walked
on in contemplative silence, my mind full of the crowd of natural
beauties that surrounded me; while my companion seemed rapt in
reflections upon the past&mdash;sometimes pausing to gaze upon a
drooping willow, at others scanning a majestic oak that grew
apart from the rest of the waving multitude, as if recollections
of a painful nature crossed his mind.</p>
<p>At length, we reached the bridge of Llangollen, where the
river is seen to great advantage, tumbling over its rocky bed,
and rushing beneath the dark shelter of the overhanging
trees.&nbsp; The village is small, and contains three respectable
inns; viz.: the Hand, at which we stopped by the advice of my
companion, the King&rsquo;s Head, and the Royal Hotel.&nbsp; We
were shewn into a very good parlour, and, after ordering a tea
and supper dinner, my friend, somewhat exhausted by the
day&rsquo;s march, flung himself once more upon a sofa, while I
resumed my journal.&nbsp; Supper or dinner, or whatever it may be
termed being over, inquiries were made about our bed rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your bed, sir, is made over the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;Yes; my mistress has but one bed unoccupied, and
she thought you would resign that to the elderly
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh certainly, my good girl; and who is to guide me
&lsquo;over the way,&rsquo; eh! for it&rsquo;s as dark as
Erebus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, John, the ostler.&nbsp; Here, John!&nbsp;
John!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And away went the girl.&nbsp; I confess I have a strong
aversion, after having taken off my boots, put on my slippers,
and made up my mind to be comfortable for the night, to be
obliged to walk some hundred yards from the parlour fireside,
across or along a damp street, in a dark night, to my bedchamber;
chilling work it is.&nbsp; At length, however, the deed was done,
and I was shewn into a bedroom, where the murmurs of the flowing
Dee were distinctly heard beneath the window.&nbsp; I felt cold
and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here am I, then,&rdquo; said I, soliloquizing, as I
pressed the pillow, &ldquo;here am I, at length, in the vale of
Llangollen&mdash;in the village of Llangollen! the spot which I
have so often longed to visit!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Flow on, thou shining river!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And how fortunate, too, to meet with such an <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>agreeable old
gentleman!&mdash;and that Bristol merchant&rsquo;s daughter, poor
girl!&mdash;and that old witch!&mdash;corpse-light!&mdash;greased
cow&rsquo;s tail!&mdash;and, in a few moments, I sank soundly to
sleep.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> dreaming of home, and
happiness, and a thousand lovely things, when I was awakened by
my new acquaintance, who stood before me dressed for a sturdy
walk, with a glass of brandy and milk in his hand, which he
advised me to finish before I quitted my room.&nbsp; I however,
contented myself with tasting it, and returning him the
remainder, which he quaffed off with <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the alacrity of one who thought
example was better than precept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lovely morning,&rdquo; said Triptolemus, rubbing his
hands with much delight; &ldquo;come, bustle, bustle, my young
friend; you are not in London, now.&nbsp; Permit me to open the
lattice; you will find no perfume at your chamber window in town
like this;&rdquo; and, as he spoke, he flung open the casement,
and a rush of fragrance poured into the room from hundreds of
roses that clustered upon the wall without.&nbsp; It was a
draught of delight which far surpassed the brandy and milk, in my
estimation; nor was my friend at all deficient in praising its
sweetness, for, taking a long breath, he stood, for a moment,
with his mouth wide open, and then sent forth a sigh, long enough
to form a bridge over the river for the fairies to cross
upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we breakfast before we set out upon our
ramble?&nbsp; I think we had better give orders for it, and visit
the cottage where Lady Elinor Butler and Miss Ponsonby so long
resided, while it is preparing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This being agreed to, we crossed over to the Hand Inn, and
gave directions for a breakfast, that would enable us to undergo
the subsequent fatigue with cheerfulness; and then struck into
the road for Plas Newydd.&nbsp; This memorable <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>little
dwelling is pleasantly situated upon a rising knoll, and commands
a delightful prospect of mountain scenery.</p>
<p>The front of the cottage is ornamented with an oaken palisade,
curiously carved with grotesque figures, giving a very tasty and
aristocratic appearance to the building.&nbsp; At the back of the
house is a neat grass plot, with a birdcote, where the robins
find a grateful shelter in the winter season, and where the
ladies fed them every morning.&nbsp; It is surrounded with a
fence of evergreens.&nbsp; From thence, the gardener, who is
still retained upon the grounds, conducted us under an archway,
to a very pleasant and winding path, which leads to a well
stocked fruit garden.&nbsp; We then descended by a shady walk,
arched over with tall trees, to the primrose vale, through which
a refreshing stream rushes over rocks, where the sun but rarely
gilds it with its beams.&nbsp; It is a delightful cool retreat,
and well calculated to awaken the dormant spirit of poesy, in any
heart where it had ever deigned to dwell.&nbsp; We passed over a
rustic bridge which led us to the veranda, from which we had a
fine view of the valley of Cewynn and the Pegwerm mountains; and
then proceeding a little farther up the glen, we seated ourselves
opposite a most picturesque font, brought hither from the ruins
<a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>of Valle
Crucis, by the late proprietors of this spot.&nbsp; It is
enclosed in a small arched niche, and supplied with the purest
water from a murmuring rill, which falls in a thin stream into
the bowl, a draught from which is an exquisite treat&mdash;for
<i>water</i> drinkers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</blockquote>
<p>The flower garden is laid out with great taste; and the little
circular dairy, sunk in the ground, on the left at the front
entrance, affords a most pleasing and picturesque effect.&nbsp;
Altogether, it is a place where any person, wearied with the <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>bustle of
society, would willingly fly for refuge, and find repose.</p>
<p>After rewarding the gardener for his attention in shewing us
the retreat, we returned, with good appetites, to do justice to
the fare provided by our host of the Hand.&nbsp; And here I was
first destined to hear the sounds of the Welsh harp.&nbsp; As we
discussed our fare, the harper in the hall played up his
liveliest tunes.&nbsp; There was not an original Welsh air in the
whole collection; for it consisted of all the popular songs that
had been bawled about the streets of London for the last three
years; and though probably new to the ears of the dwellers in
this secluded valley, were to me anything but gratifying.&nbsp; I
sent out the waiter, therefore, requesting the minstrel to play a
few of his national melodies; when he immediately commenced an
air, to which I have heard a song, I think of old Charles
Dibdin&rsquo;s, called &ldquo;The Tortoise-shell Tom
Cat.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a second attempt, I gave the thing up as
hopeless, and was obliged to content myself with the anticipation
of hearing some Welsh airs when I returned to London, as they
seemed to be exiled from their native valleys.</p>
<p>Breakfast being despatched, we slung our pistols, <i>i.e.</i>
leathern bottles, filled with <i>eau de vie</i>, to our sides,
and started to view the ruins of Dinas <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Bran, an
ancient fortress, upon the summit of a conical mountain, which
forms the principal feature of this portion of the vale, and is
indeed a striking object, from almost every part of the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The ascent begins near the foot of the
bridge opposite to the town.</p>
<p>As we passed along the street, we perceived the following
notice pasted upon the gable of a house:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Annual Festival of the Llangollen and
Llandysilio Female Club will be held, as usual, at the Hand Inn
gardens, on Tuesday, 27th of June.&nbsp; The members will walk in
procession to church, exactly at three o&rsquo;clock, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This festival,&rdquo; said my companion, &ldquo;is well
worthy of notice.&nbsp; The promoters of this valuable
institution are Mrs. Cunluff, and Mrs. Ayton, the rector&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; It was formed for the support of the aged and
afflicted, who have the benefit of food and medical attendance in
sickness and calamity, by contributing a trifle out of their
weekly wages, when in health and employment.&rdquo;&nbsp; We had
sufficient time to ascend the mountain, and return before the
procession quitted the churchyard.</p>
<p>Triptolemus was strongly built, and, being accustomed to
rambling amongst the Welsh vales, and over its steepest
mountains, far outstripped <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>me in the ascent, which was by no
means easy.&nbsp; We took a zig-zag direction up the hill, which
was too precipitate to mount in a direct way, and about half way
up I made a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish some one would invent a steam pocket apparatus,
for dragging tourists up mountains,&rdquo; said I, as I seated
myself to take breath, upon a mossy knoll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The circular hollow, by which you have taken your
seat,&rdquo; said Triptolemus, &ldquo;is dignified by a legend,
which, as you seem to be somewhat fatigued, I will relate to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>MICK MALLOW.</h3>
<p>Mick Mallow was a shepherd lad, a fond narrator of strange
stories, and a firm believer in knockers, brownies, and other
spirits that are supposed to hover about and under our
mountains.&nbsp; He declared that one night, as he sat quietly
meditating what part of the mountain he should select for his
bed, he was startled by hearing a tinkling sound near him, and
raising his head, he saw, perched upon this stone, a little man
with a pair of moss breeches, birch-leaf coat, heather-bloom
waistcoat, a yellow cap of the blossom of a furze bush, shining
stockings, and beetle-wing pumps.&nbsp; Thus equipped, he looked
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>very
smart; and in his left hand he held a fiddle, while with his
right he twanged the strings, and made the hairs of Mick&rsquo;s
head stand on end,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like quills upon the fretful
porcupine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;H&ocirc;s da i chwi!&rdquo; said the little fairy,
speaking in Welsh; which means, &ldquo;good night to
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same to you,&rdquo; said Mick, &ldquo;and many of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fond of a dance, Mick, I believe, and if
you stay here, you&rsquo;ll have an opportunity of seeing the
finest dancers in the world, or out of the world, and I&rsquo;m
the musician!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where&rsquo;s your harp?&rdquo; said Mick,
&ldquo;and what&rsquo;s that ugly outlandish thing you&rsquo;ve
got under your arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s my fiddle,&rdquo; said the little man,
&ldquo;and you shall bear me play it, presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Mick saw hundreds of little spirits ascending the
mountain; some of them carrying glow-worms in their hands for
torches; some dressed in white, some in green, and some in
brown.&nbsp; But all the females were in white, and on they came,
dancing and singing; but so lightly did they trip, that not a
drop of dew was seen to be displaced by their weight; and every
one saluted Mick with a &ldquo;good night to ye, Mick
Mallow,&rdquo; and to every one he made a suitable reply,
marvelling how so many well <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>dressed spirits should know him so
well; and he was, to say the truth, greatly frightened and
astonished at his new acquaintance.</p>
<p>At length the little man, who had invited him to remain where
he was, drew his bow thrice across the strings of his instrument
and produced such exquisite tones, that Mick opened his eyes
still wider, and pricked up his ears with delight.&nbsp; This
multitude of spirits had now ranged themselves in fantastic
groups, forming altogether a spacious circle round the stone upon
which their musician stood, who then waved his fiddle stick, and
striking three chords on the fiddle, away they went dancing round
and round, slowly at first, and Mick thought Peg Willis, the
drover&rsquo;s daughter, couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to any one
of them, though she was generally considered the best dancer at
any festival for many miles round.&nbsp; Now Mick was fond of a
dance himself, and could hardly forbear joining them; but his
fears prevented him, for he thought that dancing on a mountain at
night, to perhaps the devil&rsquo;s fiddle, was not the likeliest
way to get to heaven.&nbsp; But, when the dance became more
spirited, he felt his heels knocking together, and he snapped his
fingers and joined in the air with his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, well done,&rdquo; cried the little man who
played, &ldquo;come and join in the dance Mick, <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>I&rsquo;ll
warrant you never saw such dancing at any wedding, as you see
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! never! never!&rdquo; cried Mick, and all the
company laughed softly, and danced faster and faster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and join us,&rdquo; cried they; and Mick rubbed
his head, while his heels kept time; at length, he was so
delighted by the motions of a fairy, who threw her bright glances
at him now and then, that with an irresistable desperation he
called out for them to stop, till he got into the centre of them,
which he had no sooner done than he roared out, &ldquo;Now, you
old devil, play up Brimstone and Water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had he uttered these words, than the figure of the
little man underwent a change!&nbsp; The yellow cap vanished from
his head, and a pair of goat&rsquo;s horns, branched out from his
head; his face turned black as soot, his leafy coat,
heather-bloom waistcoat and moss breeches, with shining
stockings, vanished, and left a black body with a long tail!
while his beetle-wing shoes disappeared as suddenly and left
nothing but the cloven feet.&nbsp; Mick&rsquo;s heart was heavy,
but his heels were light; horror was in his breast, but mirth was
in every motion.&nbsp; The fays assumed a variety of forms, some
like goats, others like crows; some changed to beetles and others
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>to
batts! all the varieties of flesh and fowl seemed to be the grand
movers of the revel, from the moment he entered the enchanted
circle.&nbsp; The dance, at length, became so furious that he
could not perceive the forms of the dancers distinctly.&nbsp; The
rapidity with which they flew round and round made them resemble
a wheel of fire at a white heat.&nbsp; Still he danced on,
although he would very willingly have stopped, but his legs
capered in spite of his will, while old Nick, in the centre,
continued to play with unceasing vigour and seemingly much
diverted with the entertainment.</p>
<p>Mick&rsquo;s master, an honest early-rising man, roamed up the
mountain, at break of day, to view his sheep and goats, which he
saw quietly browsing in various parts, but, on nearing this spot,
you may imagine his astonishment, when he beheld his shepherd
dancing in that most extraordinary manner; leaping, twisting and
turning in every direction; for some time, he stood mute with
astonishment.&nbsp; At length, he drew near, and no sooner did
Mick perceive his master, than he roared out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop
me! stop me! oh master, stop me!&rdquo; upon which the master
came close up to him, and was knocked down by an extra fling of
Mick&rsquo;s leg, as he roared still louder, &ldquo;Stop me,
master, stop me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>Having recovered his feet, the old man stared quite
bewildered and exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, what in the name of the
Virgin!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no sooner had he uttered the word, than the charm was
broken, and poor Mick sank senseless to the earth.&nbsp; When
sufficiently recovered, he recounted the marvellous tale, and
declared that all appeared to him as a dream.&nbsp; But the
circle remains, round the edge of the hollow, where the fairies
disappeared, which the peasants assert to be the fairy&rsquo;s
foot mark to this day. <a name="citation107"></a><a

<p>We now proceeded on our ascent, which became more difficult,
as we approached the summit, and after a little toil we stood by
the side of the <i>well</i>, whose pure waters gave joy to the
inhabitants of this ancient fortress many hundred years ago, and
still offer a welcome draught to the pilgrim who has sufficient
enterprise and perseverance to seek it.</p>
<p>The view from the summit of this mountain is beautiful in the
extreme; commanding the vale from east to west, with the widely
spreading plains beyond its eastern extremity, and the grand and
picturesque mountain scenery which forms the western
boundary.&nbsp; Chirk Castle, Wynstay, Valle Crucis and
Glyndwrdwy are distinctly <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>visible from this elevation, while
the romantic Dee is seen winding beneath, in light and shadow
beautifully varied by the hills, and the woods that droop over
its banks.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Standing amid the ruins of this ancient British fortress, I
observed it was surely impossible that a spot so romantic could
be without its legends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said my companion, &ldquo;and I
will relate one of a young lady, who once resided within these
walls.&nbsp; That she did live here, and was esteemed very
beautiful, there is little reason to doubt, since the Welsh bards
have handed her down to posterity.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>MY FAWNY VYCHAN,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND THE MINSTREL FAY.</span></h3>
<p>My Fawny Vychan was a celebrated beauty of the fourteenth
century, and was the inspirer of many a bard&rsquo;s most admired
effusions.&nbsp; She was of the house of Tudor Trevor, and her
father Ednyfed Vychan then held the castle, under the noble Earl
of Arundel, in the reign of the unfortunate Richard II.&nbsp;
Among her numerous admirers was Evan, a youthful bard of great
beauty, but of mysterious birth; but her heart was given to a
valiant knight, named Howell Einion, <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the son of Gwalchmai, the son of
Meilir, the Lord of Tre Veilir in Anglesea, who was esteemed the
greatest ornament of chivalry.&nbsp; He was daring, young and
handsome, three qualifications that find grace in the eyes of all
ladies, at all periods; but added to these he was a celebrated
bard and a fine musician.&nbsp; Evan was gentle, delicate and
retiring, and she could only yield him her esteem.&nbsp; Yet
nightly did he hover near her casement, and, with the voice of
love, pour forth his soul in melody beneath it.&nbsp; One
evening, at the close of autumn, she listened, while tears of
pity fell from her bright eyes, to the well known voice of
Evan.</p>
<blockquote><p>The breeze had left the Berwyn hills,<br />
The dew was on the flower,<br />
The bee had sought his honeycomb,<br />
The bird was in his bower;<br />
When swifter than the mountain gale,<br />
And fresh as sparkling dew,<br />
My bee, I sought thy honey-home,<br />
My bird, to thee I flew!</p>
<p>My Alban steed is white with foam,<br />
And droops his arched neck;<br />
The flood, the mountain, moor, and glen,<br />
He cross&rsquo;d without a check!<br />
Oh listen, while my harp I strike,<br />
And rouse its sweetest tone,<br />
And hear the language of a heart,<br />
Which beats for thee alone!</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>Oh,
dearest of the mortal race!<br />
How peerless must thou be,<br />
When spirits quit their happy homes,<br />
To love, and gaze on thee!<br />
Arise, bright star of beauty, rise!<br />
And when from thee I roam,<br />
Send forth the lustre of thine eyes,<br />
To light me to my home!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evan, after this touching appeal, remained for some time
beneath the window, gazing upwards, in the hope that she would
grant him one farewell; but disappointed, he turned sorrowfully
to depart, when his progress was arrested, by the sudden grasp of
an armed hand, and Einion stood before him.&nbsp; Howell had
often observed, that the eyes of the young minstrel filled with
tears as he gazed upon the beautiful face of his mistress, and
was not pleased with the discovery.&nbsp; His fine eyes, now
flashed with anger upon Evan, who returned the glance as
haughtily, and, but for the delicate frame of the minstrel, the
knight would have revenged himself upon the object of his
jealousy.&nbsp; Evan&rsquo;s eyes were black as jet, his face was
femininely fair, and his transparent skin was tinged with that
beautiful, but fatal hue, which brightens the cheeks of those
already doomed to the consumptive fiend, who flatters while he
destroys.</p>
<p>He was slightly formed, but exquisitely moulded, and so light
was his footstep, that his <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>tread was scarcely heard, so that he
obtained the application of the Minstrel Fay.</p>
<p>No one knew his parents, or from whence he came.&nbsp; His
dress was of the best though plainest materials of the time;
destitute of all the absurdities that marked the costume of the
period; and his steed, which brought him to the castle, and bore
him away from it again, was of the purest white, and fleeter than
any in the baron&rsquo;s stables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your steed stands in the valley, Minstrel Fay,&rdquo;
said Howel; &ldquo;descend and vanish on his back, swifter than
you came hither, or I shall hurl you from the battlements,
and&mdash;why!&mdash;have I been dreaming!&rdquo; continued the
astonished knight, with an exclamation of disappointment, mingled
with fear, as he stood with his arm outstretched and his hand
clenched, as though he still retained the minstrel in his hold;
instead of whom, it grasped an aspen branch, which, broken by the
gripe, he dashed on the ground.&nbsp; Suddenly, an unearthly
strain of melody arose from the woody dell, and he distinctly
heard the following words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One glance from those seraphic eyes,<br />
To light me o&rsquo;er the plain;<br />
One silver word to cheer my soul,<br />
And I am gone again!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>&ldquo;What ho!&rdquo; cried the knight, &ldquo;Maldor!
d&rsquo;Espard!&rdquo;&nbsp; Two squires were instantly at his
side.&nbsp; &ldquo;By heaven, witchery is at work,
d&rsquo;Espard! saddle brown Terror.&nbsp; The Minstrel Fay is in
the valley, and find him this night I am determined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse was quickly brought, and, attended by his two
followers, he descended the mountain, at a desperate pace, in the
direction from whence the sounds proceeded.&nbsp; The whole of
that night did he gallop over hills, and through deep glens, in
pursuit of Evan; but no trace of him could he find, and at
length, wearied and exhausted with fatigue, he returned to Dinas
Bran, believing all that he had seen a dream.</p>
<p>At the morning&rsquo;s meal, he related the story to My Fawny
and her father.&nbsp; The venerable lord jested with him upon his
sleep-walking, as he termed it, and bade him, &ldquo;have better
thoughts of poor Evan, for,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our land does
not contain a sweeter minstrel, or a finer bard.&nbsp; He is the
pride of my hall, and the delight of all my noble friends.&nbsp;
The only thing I am inclined to censure him for, is his
absence.&nbsp; He must belong to noble blood, for his garb
bespeaks him gentle, and his attainments are those of one who has
received an education such as few of us can boast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&ldquo;I trust, baron,&rdquo; said Einion, (a little
piqued at this high commendation), &ldquo;you will allow, he
would be loath to enter the lists with me, in mortal encounter;
and, for the accomplishments which belong to men of rank, I have
laboured to be considered no mean scholar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why as a knight and bard, I grant you, few can equal
Howel ap Einion; at feast and tourney, you ever shine amongst the
first of England&rsquo;s youth,&rdquo; said the good natured
baron; &ldquo;but, my brave boy, do not dislike poor Howell,
because his education has been different from yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, my lord; I only wish he would not look so
meltingly at your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Fawny turned pale, but not from guilt; it was for fear that
her lover&rsquo;s suspicious mind might prove dangerous to the
poor youth, of whose hopeless affection she was aware, and vainly
regretted.&nbsp; Her lover noticed the change; and so did her
father, who instantly said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, to end the dispute about who is most fitted
to be my daughter&rsquo;s husband, I have resolved that of all
her suitors, he who shall prove best leaper in the approaching
British Olympic at Plas-Gwynn, shall have my daughter&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; Will you enter the lists?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will venture to risk my happiness upon <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>the leap,
or upon my success in any one in the whole list of games; and, I
doubt not, but love will assist me to bear off the prize.&nbsp;
But, should I fail&mdash;&rdquo; said he, in a tone of
tenderness, as he took the maiden&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;would My
Fawny drop a tear upon my grave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lovely girl lifted her dark eyes to those of her
lover&rsquo;s, and the impetuous knight felt at once assured of
her undivided affection.</p>
<p>The intervening days passed rapidly, while costly preparations
were made for the games that were to take place at Plas
Gwynn.</p>
<p>During this time, Evan was never seen, although Einion often
fancied, at the still hour of night, he heard a harp, and the
soft voice of the minstrel, near the window of his mistress.</p>
<p>It is sufficient to say that Howell&rsquo;s belief in his
superiority over the rest of the competitors was justly founded;
and he won the lady by covering the immense distance of fifty
feet at a hop, step, and jump, over the brook called Abernodwydd;
in commemoration of which feat three stones, at the precise
intervals, were immediately erected on the spot, where they still
remain to this day, in a dingle called, &ldquo;<i>Naid
Abernodwydd</i>, or <i>The Leap of
Abernodwydd</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;See Jones&rsquo;s Bardic Museum,
Vol. II.</p>
<p>The games being finished, the lovers returned <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>to Dinas
Bran, and the happy day at length arrived.</p>
<p>Bards of the highest order were seated in the banqueting hall,
and minstrels tuned their harps to joy and gratulation; but Evan
was not there.&nbsp; The baron sat at the head of the board, his
daughter and son-in-law on either hand.&nbsp; And many an anxious
wish he felt, for his favourite bard, and many an eager glance
did he cast around the illuminated hall, hoping to discover him
amongst the crowd; but in vain; and he felt uneasy at his
absence.&nbsp; Every guest expressed wonder that he was not there
to celebrate so happy an event, and he became the topic of
conversation with all assembled.</p>
<p>At length, the time for departure arrived, and the last bard
had recited his complimentary verses, when the door was flung
open at the lower end of the room, and Evan, his harp hung behind
him, with a tottering step advanced towards the upper end of the
hall, where the new married couple sat gazing in speechless
wonder at his altered form.&nbsp; There was an unearthly
expression in his face; the bloom which used to mantle on his
cheeks, was no longer there; his eyes were sunk deeply in their
sockets, and the vermilion of his lip was turned to ashy
paleness.&nbsp; A seat was given <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>him; and, without speaking, he
placed his harp before him, and touching its strings, a sound of
heavenly music swelled up to the lofty roof.&nbsp; None ventured
to breathe audibly, while he sang</p>
<h3>THE MINSTREL&rsquo;S KNELL.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My Fawny Vechan! brightest maid,<br />
In scarlet robes and gold array&rsquo;d!<br />
My Fawny Vechan! fairest fair,<br />
That ever breath&rsquo;d the mountain air!<br />
For thee do spirits pine and fade,<br />
As blossoms in the chilling shade,<br />
Debarr&rsquo;d from Ph&oelig;bus&rsquo; genial light,<br />
Sink victims to the withering blight.<br />
My Fawny Vechan! hear my prayer!<br />
Thy lover&rsquo;s&mdash;tho&rsquo; <i>a child of air</i>!<br />
May peace on earth, and bliss above,<br />
Wait on the mortal whom I love!<br />
My outward form of misery<br />
Tells what the spirit feels for thee!<br />
Farewell, farewell! no more the pride<br />
Of sweet Dwrdwy&rsquo;s mossy side,<br />
In distant vales, I&rsquo;ll breathe my woes,<br />
And seek, ah, vain, vain hope! repose!<br />
Ah! cou&rsquo;d I die, I&rsquo;d not repine,<br />
If Evan&rsquo;s name might live with thine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the commencement of his song, the figure of Evan became
fainter and fainter, and the torches and huge candles that
illuminated the ball assumed a dimmer light.&nbsp; <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>The guests,
terror stricken, were riveted to their seats; none presumed to
speak their fears; and the whole assembly appeared, as they had
been transformed, in the positions they occupied while living,
into cold marble, so immoveable and inanimate did they
seem.&nbsp; On a sudden, the figure of Evan vanished!&mdash;The
substantial harp falling upon the floor restored the guests to
motion; while Einion&rsquo;s attention was called to the
restoration of his lovely bride, who, at the melancholy close of
the fairy&rsquo;s song, had fainted, and still lay insensible in
the arms of her father, the baron.</p>
<p>The stone, at the upper end of the banqueting hall, is said to
mark the spot upon which, for the last time, was heard the melody
of &ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Minstrel Fay</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;A very pretty fable; and now let us return, to witness
the procession at Llangollen,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>Having taken refreshment, we proceeded to the church-yard, and
stationed ourselves near a monument to the memory of Lady Eleanor
Butler, Miss Ponsonby, and their faithful servant, Mrs. Mary
Carrol.&nbsp; From this interesting spot, we beheld a novel
sight.&nbsp; Two or three hundred villagers had assembled, and
were scattered about the churchyard in groups; <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>some,
stretched upon their backs, were sleeping on the flat tombstones,
their hardy features protected from the scorching rays of the sun
by the gay cotton handkerchief or the straw hat; some stood in
knots, conversing upon the results likely to take place from
petticoat government (for the proclamation had been received only
the day previous); others gazing with eager eyes, upon a flight
of steps, up which a number of smart village girls, with laughing
eyes and ruddy faces, tripped lightly to a doorway, which
entering, they, one by one, like shadows, disappeared.&nbsp;
Every moment, the cemetery became more crowded, and, as I
noticed, principally with the infirm and aged.&nbsp; Before me
stood a palsy stricken creature, whose white locks waved about
her face at every motion of her feeble head.&nbsp; Then came a
form, once, doubtless, erect and handsome, but now by age so
bent, that his head found a melancholy parallel with his hips,
and a beechen staff supported his debilitated body.&nbsp; Another
and another still pressed on, the sick, the lame, thronging to
the gay scene, anticipating joy!&nbsp; As they passed, however,
my busy fancy led them one by one, into a separate grave,
realizing the awful conception of the Dance of Death!</p>
<p>A strange, discordant sound, awakened me <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>from my
reverie, and, although horribly harsh, I gave it welcome, for it
banished a gloomy spirit from my mind.&nbsp; Turning my eyes
towards the flight of steps, I saw the girls descending, each
decorated with a white shawl with a blue border, and bearing a
wand, (it being the symbol and costume of the society), at the
top of which were laurel, and laurestinus leaves, intermingled
with roses, lillies, etc., etc.&nbsp; The beadle of the parish,
who on these occasions is no insignificant personage, was seen
bustling about, arranging the form of procession, bringing
forward this one, pushing back that, keeping order, and knocking
the boys&rsquo; hats over their eyes for having approached the
lines too closely; while the motley band, in various keys played,
&ldquo;Oh the roast Beef of Old England;&rdquo; rather
mal-&agrave;-propos, as I thought, as they were about to enter
the church, and hear a sermon which is regularly preached on this
day.</p>
<p>The line now stretched to a considerable extent, and the lady
patronesses appeared to be much delighted at viewing the busy
scene, as they hurried to and fro, with benevolence beaming in
their eyes; while old age, and decrepitude, cast away their
sorrows and hailed the jocund scene.</p>
<p>All being ready, the rector and his curate <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>placed
themselves in the van, the lady patronesses followed, and to the
sound of the inspiring bassoon, drum, keyed bugle, and cracked
trumpet, they proceeded by the iron gate, through ranks of happy
human beings ranged on either side, like old oaks, young
saplings, nettles and pea blossoms, huddled together in
&ldquo;promiscuous alliance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having taken a
prescribed circuit, they again entered the churchyard by another
gate, and passed into the church; when a discourse, very much to
the purpose, was given by the rector; after which, they adjourned
to the Hand hotel, where they had a tea-total entertainment, and
passed the evening in strolling about the gardens, listening to
the inimitable band of wind instruments, which brayed out an
execrable accompaniment to the exquisite music of the Dee, as it
swept beneath them, overshadowed by the drooping foliage of the
opposite bank.&nbsp; Altogether, it was a most gratifying
sight&mdash;for the simple souls were happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning, we bade
adieu to Llangollen, and proceeded first to Valle Crucis.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p121b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Valle Crucis Abbey"
title=
"Valle Crucis Abbey"
 src="images/p121s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Like most abbeys, it is beautifully situated.&nbsp; The monks
of old well appreciated the value of <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>rich lands and clear streams.&nbsp;
An old woman received us at the gate, and instantly began to
retail her information.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gryffyd ap Madoc, Lord of
Bromfield and Yale, founded this abbey in the year
1200.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are parts of both church and abbey still
remaining; the former was cruciform, and exhibits several styles
of architecture.&nbsp; The eastern end is the most ancient; it is
adorned by three lancet slips, forming one grand window.&nbsp;
The entrance was in the west, under a broad and beautiful window,
above which is a smaller one, of a marigold form, decorated with
tracery and fret-work, and beneath it may be deciphered the
following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>A.D.A.M.D.N.S fecit hoc opus, pace beat&acirc;
quiescat Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cloisters are turned into a farmhouse and offices.</p>
<p>This noble edifice was dismantled by Henry VIII.&nbsp; My
companion, feeling desirous to bathe in the clear waters, left me
to my contemplations, encompassed by the ruined walls of the
abbey, and tall ash trees, which shaded the area of the
church.&nbsp; I wandered from thence to the fish pond, which is
near to the abbey, and, while my companion was enjoying his
ablutions, my muse jogged my arm, and reminded <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>me that
some tribute was due from me to this lovely spot.&nbsp; Taking
out my pocket book and pencil, I produced the following</p>
<h3>LINES WRITTEN AT VALLE CRUCIS.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Monastic Valle Crucis! while I linger in thy
shade,<br />
The spirits of the olden time seem moving in the glade;<br />
Rebuilt appear thy ruined walls, and thou art strong again,<br />
As when the organ through those aisles poured forth its solemn
strain.</p>
<p>Here reigneth peace and solitude, as if some holy spell<br />
Still charmed the blessed region where religion loved to
dwell;<br />
No music, save the streamlet&rsquo;s voice, disturbs the deep
serene,<br />
And breezy sounds sweet murmuring throughout the woodlands
green.</p>
<p>Oh fallen Valle Crucis! full six hundred years are gone<br />
Since the warlike lord of Dinas Bean laid thy foundation
stone;<br />
And mighty didst thou flourish, till that fell destroyer came,<br
/>
Than mouldering time more ruthless, and of sacrilegious name.</p>
<p>Then, holy Valle Crucis! was thy sacred roof thrown down,<br
/>
Thy peaceful inmates scattered, rent the sacerdotal gown;<br />
The mournful ivy clustered o&rsquo;er thy grey and ruined
walls,<br />
And ash trees sprang, where torches blazed, within thy sainted
halls.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>Hushed are the lips of all who dwelt within that
cloistered fane;<br />
And holy feet will never press the polished floors again,<br />
At morning prayer and vesper hymn, which thrilled thy very
stones&mdash;<br />
Forgotten now those pious ones, and whitened are their bones!</p>
<p>Yet ivy&rsquo;d Valle Crucis! thou art fairer in decay<br />
Than all the splendid structures which adorn our modern day;<br
/>
In every mouldering fragment of thy consecrated pile<br />
There&rsquo;s a charm to all who view thy walls, or tread thy
broken aisle.</p>
<p>Peace dwell around thee ever! may no heedless hand molest<br
/>
The solemn bird which builds in thee its ivy-mantled nest,<br />
Whose breathings seem the deep-drawn sighs of bosoms fraught with
pain,<br />
Lamenting the departed, who will ne&rsquo;er return again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The porteress of this ancient building is Ann Dale, who has
lived in this solitary but delightful spot for two years; and,
although a Shropshire woman, has made herself, during that
period, sufficiently acquainted with the Welsh language to
discourse fluently with the country people, in their native
tongue; and has moreover committed to memory everything
interesting, relative to the spot where she resides.&nbsp; It is
evidently her delight to point out to strangers <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>the objects
most worthy their attention; and her love of the venerable pile
has induced her to take spade in hand, and clear away the rubbish
that perhaps had for centuries been accumulating round the
columns, leaving them clear to their foundations.&nbsp; Time has
been over busy with her features; but her limbs are as active as
those of a girl of sixteen, and her spirits are as light as her
heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir!&rdquo; said she, after enumerating the good
offices she had received from the neighbouring gentry, and the
friendly feelings of the more humble classes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always made it a rule, throughout my life, to be civil to every
body.&nbsp; Civility costs nothing, you know, and I&rsquo;m
always surprised to hear people, when they are asked a simple
question, if they chance to have a better coat on their backs
than the person who addresses them, give an answer as if they
were speaking to cattle, or worse brutes, when you know, sir,
(approaching the cottage at the head of the pond) we are all the
same flesh and blood, (pausing on the second step.)&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t say but there ought to be distinctions, for we
can&rsquo;t be all gentlefolks, (entering.)&nbsp; But then,
where&rsquo;s the difference, when we are as them that lie in the
abbey there? or like these poor bones that I have in a box here,
(opening <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>it and displaying some human relics.)&nbsp; They all
comed out of the abbey ground, Sir.&nbsp; Why these might be a
bishop&rsquo;s, or a great warrior&rsquo;s, for aught we know to
the contrary.&nbsp; Well, sir, after all, there&rsquo;s nothing
like good common sense.&nbsp; Solomon prayed for good sense, and
he had it; and, thank God, I have it, too.&nbsp; Now, sir, come
this way (leading back to the margin of the monks&rsquo; pond)
and I&rsquo;ll show you something that shows what a thing
Providence is.&nbsp; You see that stone jar there, sir&mdash;just
there in the water; well, sir, you know there are no flies in the
winter; so the poor fish would be sorely put about for food, but
for Providence.&nbsp; Well, upon that jar I&rsquo;ve seen
thousands and thousands of things like shells and patches of grey
moss; and I&rsquo;ve seen the trout cluster about it, and feed
upon &rsquo;em often.&nbsp; And, whenever I thinks of that, sir,
it brings to my mind the 104th Psalm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the name of that mountain, my good lady, to
S.E. of the abbey?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why that, sir, is called Fron Fawr.&nbsp; It is 1328
feet above the level of the sea, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thanked her for her information; and, prompted by an
incontrollable appetite, ventured to ask if she could supply us
with anything eatable.</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said she
&ldquo;that I have nothing that you&rsquo;ll like, sir; for
I&rsquo;m a poor lone woman, and what suits me, wouldn&rsquo;t
perhaps sit upon your honour&rsquo;s stomach.&nbsp; But there
<i>were</i> a party here this morning, and they left behind
&rsquo;em a pork-pie, because the dish got broke, and a piece of
apple tart; and I have gotten a piece of oatcake, and a piece of
cheese; if you could manage to put up with that, sir,
you&rsquo;re quite welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talk of Christmas times, of roast beef and plum pudding!&nbsp;
Give me June, with cold pork-pie, apple tart, and cheese, in a
summer-house overlooking a monk&rsquo;s pond, and surrounded by
waving woods and lofty trees, in view of the ruined abbey,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where monks of old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I&rsquo;ve been told<br />
Quaffed the merry, merry nut brown ale.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the time my travelling friend had returned from his bath,
the table was furnished with fare calculated to satisfy his
appetite, at the expense of pork-pie, tart, etc.&nbsp; Mixing the
contents of our united flasks with the pure cool waters of the
refreshing spring, inhaling the perfume of Havannah, and making a
sofa out of two wooden chairs, we amused ourselves with a
retrospective <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>view of the scenes we had passed through since we
met.&nbsp; It was now twelve o&rsquo;clock, and, as it was my
intention to reach Bala by nightfall, we rose to depart; and with
many thanks and kind wishes from the old porteress of Valle
Crucis, quitted that interesting ruin, and proceeded to</p>
<h3>THE PILLAR OF ELISEG.</h3>
<p>It stands in a meadow, a short distance from the abbey, and
was a memorial of the dead; an improvement on the rude columns of
Druidical times, sculptured into form, and surrounded with
inscriptions.&nbsp; It is among the first lettered stones that
succeed the Meini-Hirion, Meini-Gwyr and Llechan, and stood on a
great tumulus, perhaps always environed with wood, according to
the custom of the most ancient times, when standing pillars were
placed under every green tree.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p128b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Pillar of Eliseg"
title=
"Pillar of Eliseg"
 src="images/p128s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This pillar was erected above a thousand years ago, to the
memory of Eliseg, the father of a Prince of Powis, called Rochwel
Yscythrog, who met his death at the battle of Chester, in
607.&nbsp; During the civil wars, this pillar was thrown down,
and broken, and the shaft which was originally above twelve feet
in length, is now only eight.&nbsp; At the suggestion of the Rev.
John <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>Price, Bodleian librarian, and great antiquary, Mr.
Lloyd, of Trevor Hall, had it placed in its present position.</p>
<p>At this spot, my companion and I were to separate.&nbsp; I
felt the approaching loss severely; for where could I expect to
find another so amusing and so kind?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come and see me at Rhuthyn?&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a snug cottage, a good housekeeper, a
bed, and as good a glass of port as you will find in the
neighbourhood;&mdash;promise to visit me at your
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I promised not to forget his hospitable invitation, and, with
a feeling of regret I never before experienced at quitting a new
acquaintance of so short standing, I squeezed his hand&mdash;and
we parted.</p>
<p>From Valle Crucis Abbey, I proceeded to the banks of the Dee,
and crossing the rude bridge over the river struck into the high
road to Corwen, and proceeded at a brisk pace.&nbsp; The country
became highly interesting.&nbsp; The mountains are lofty; and
beneath, upon the right, Glyndwrdwy, <i>the valley of the
Dee</i>, discloses its picturesque beauty.&nbsp; This was the
property of the celebrated Owen Glyndwr.</p>
<p>The vale is so serpentine that it presents a succession of
most exquisite views, and after <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>a walk of three miles, on looking
back, Castle Dinas Bran seems placed upon a lower eminence.&nbsp;
The valley of Llangollen may be seen likewise from hence for many
miles, terminated by the distant mountains.</p>
<p>After passing the fourth mile stone, the road takes a straight
direction; and at this spot I came up with a person who, seated
upon the road, was extracting some very tolerable music from one
end of his walking cane.&nbsp; He was a tall thin man, with sharp
features and large blue eyes.&nbsp; He had on a broad brimmed
glazed hat, a blue frock coat, with nankeen pantaloons, short
gaiters, and shoes.&nbsp; The rest of his wardrobe was wrapped in
a pocket handkerchief; and his name, as I afterwards learnt, was
Whiffler.</p>
<p>Upon my approaching him, he withdrew his musical cane from his
mouth, and observed that it seemed likely to rain; and, by the
misty appearance of the atmosphere before us, I concluded he was
right in his observations; for in that direction the country was
nearly obscured, while behind us, the sun sent forth his
brightest beams upon mountain and stream; though the valleys
partly slept in shadow, as he slowly journeyed to his western
couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travelling far, sir?&rdquo; inquired my new
companion.</p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>&ldquo;At my leisure,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine road, this, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you fond of music?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passionately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was sufficient encouragement to make my new acquaintance
turn his staff once more into an instrument of sound, and he
played a wild kind of march, which he assured me was called
&ldquo;The War Tramp of Owen Glyndwr,&rdquo; the Welsh chieftain,
who was so formidable an enemy to Henry IV.&mdash;Taking up the
idea, I endeavoured to compose some appropriate lines for the
air.&nbsp; (See music plate.) <a name="citation130"></a><a
href="#footnote130" class="citation">[130]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the kindness, sir,&rdquo; said my companion,
&ldquo;to step out with your left foot at the beginning of the
bar, and you will find it excellent marching time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I complied with the whimsical request, and he seemed much
pleased at my readiness to oblige his humour; for he blew away
unceasingly, and I dare say would never have thought of stopping,
had I not pointed out a handsome house to him, upon the opposite
hill, and requested him to tell me the name of its
proprietor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that semibreve, in the middle of that
forest of demi-semi-quavers?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>I
laughed at his conceit, and replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that belongs to Mr. Jones, and is called
Llandysilio Hall&mdash;a very worthy man.&nbsp; This glen, sir,
has been the scene of many sanguinary conflicts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he struck up &ldquo;The Battle of Prague,&rdquo; and we
marched on for about a mile further, when he suddenly stopped
short before a small public house, upon the road side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that a small
drop of brandy, mixed with a little mulled ale, sugar and nutmeg,
would make us get over the next four
miles&mdash;prestissimo&mdash;eh?&nbsp; Con spirito,
um?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I agreed to the con spirito, but assured him a moderato
movement would suit my inclination better for the remainder of
the walk to Corwen.&nbsp; He then led the way into the house; and
certainly, of all the comforts a tourist can experience, that of
seeing a neatly sanded room, with shining oaken seats and tables,
walls white as snow, pans and pots glittering in well ordered
arrangement against them, a fine polished kitchen range enclosing
a good fire, and a smiling, civil, hospitable hostess anxious to
attend your commands, however trifling they may be, is the <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>most
desirable.&nbsp; I never saw any country where so much attention
is paid to the cleanliness of the interior of their cottages, if
I except Holland, and in this respect the peasantry resemble each
other.</p>
<p>Having despatched this agreeable beverage, we resumed our
walk, and in about ten minutes, the rain, which had long been
threatening us, fell in torrents, and we resembled a couple of
half drowned rats as we faced the storm.</p>
<p>My companion, with a half-comic and half melancholy cast of
countenance, observed, &ldquo;I declare, I can hardly make my
instrument speak, although I have got a natural shake in my
voice, as you may hear.&nbsp; Very cold, sir; isn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; Look yonder,&rdquo; continued he, pointing to a clump
of fir trees.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, sir, once stood the celebrated
wooden house, attached to the mansion of that mighty warrior and
magician who could</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Call spirits from the vasty
deep&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for the purpose of lodging the guests.&nbsp; The mansion stood
upon our left, and was formerly of grand dimensions, they say;
though now alas! not a vestige of it remains.&nbsp; The site of
the visitor&rsquo;s lodging rooms commands a fine prospect <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>of the
valley.&nbsp; Perhaps you would like to walk up to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly;&rdquo; and, accordingly, we jumped over a
stile and climbed to the summit of the mound, from which a
glorious view of the valley was obtained.&nbsp; Upon reaching the
top, the traveller is surprised to find, that what he looked upon
as a mere mound, when viewed from the road, assumes the form of a
tremendous precipice as he looks down upon the dark waters of the
Dee, (which wind around its base), and glances over the fertile
valley stretched far beneath, where Glyndwr vanquished the
oppressor Grey.&nbsp; I had fallen into a reverie, from which I
was awakened by the shrill sounds of the musician&rsquo;s fife
stick, which startled me with its discordant notes, and brought
me back from the fourteenth century to the nineteenth, with a
celerity far from pleasing.</p>
<p>As we resumed our walk, we heard the rumbling of wheels, and
the tramp of horses behind us, and pausing to see what vehicle
was approaching, we beheld a kind of van, drawn by two enormous
animals, as large as any of the breed employed in some of the
London breweries.&nbsp; They were driven by a young man, of about
nineteen years of age.</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>&ldquo;Will you ride as far as Corwen?&rdquo; said he,
at the same time pulling up his horses.</p>
<p>As the rain was falling fast, and this conveyance promised to
carry us to the town in half the time it would take us to walk
thither, we gladly accepted the offer.&nbsp; I mounted by the
side of the driver, having always a predilection for that seat;
while my more prudent musical acquaintance jumped into the body
of the cart, and was presently lost sight of beneath a dozen coal
sacks, that covered several ale casks.</p>
<p>I soon found that my situation was far from being
enviable.&nbsp; In the first place, there was no foot board, and
I kept slipping forward, every now and then, at the hazard of
falling upon the horses&rsquo; heels.&nbsp; The air became more
keen, the rain rattled upon my visage with greater violence than
ever, and silently I confessed&mdash;forgive me ye gnomes and
demons of the storm!&mdash;that notwithstanding the grandeur of
the mountain-torrent, I should at that time have given a
preference to a little of the &ldquo;mountain dew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, I heard the shrill sound of the fife issuing from
underneath the sacks, to the tune of &ldquo;Over the hills and
far away,&rdquo; and was about requesting the driver to stop,
until I joined <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>my companion in his lair, when a smart lash upon the
flank of the near horse made him dart off at a pace which defied
all the efforts of the Welsh boor to check.&nbsp; With his right
arm holding fast by the front rail of the caravan, he with his
left pulled with all his strength to keep the horses in the road,
and we dashed along, first upon one side, and then upon the
other, for the middle was never kept, until I began to look out
for the most comfortable landing place.&nbsp; I then caught hold
of the near horse&rsquo;s rein, while he tugged away at the
other.&nbsp; The seat was slippery, and the reins were wet, and
our united efforts would have failed in checking their speed; but
espying a hill about half a mile a-head of us,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, keep &rsquo;em together,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and let them have their race out, for they must stop at
yonder hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time the fife was whistling like mad, &ldquo;Go to
the devil and shake yourselves;&rdquo; and Mr. Whiffler was
luxuriating in blessed ignorance of our danger.</p>
<p>Having made up my mind to the worst, but hoping for the best,
I regaled myself with a sup of brandy from the pistol at my side,
and then handed it to the driver, who drank&mdash;as if he liked
it.&nbsp; We by this time reached the foot of <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>the hill,
at the same slashing pace, and began the ascent in a first rate
style; but, when we had got about half way up, we were startled
by a loud cry behind us, and, upon turning my head, I saw poor
Mr. Whiffler seated in the middle of the road, flourishing his
musical cane, and shouting most vociferously for us to
stop.&nbsp; It seemed that he was amusing himself with his
favourite airs, and never felt the gradual retiring motion of the
sacks as we ascended the hill, until he was fairly shot out at
the tail of the van, where he lay sprawling; but, thanks to the
friendly sacks, unhurt.</p>
<p>Our frisky Flander&rsquo;s steeds, coming to the push at the
steep rising ground, relaxed in their rapid course, became quiet
as lambs, and at the summit of the bill were very glad to come to
a dead halt to recover their breath; giving my musical friend
ample time to come up with us, which he had no sooner done, than,
as if nothing had occurred worth mentioning, he resumed his
situation in the van, and struck up &ldquo;Drops of
brandy.&rdquo;&nbsp; I took the hint, and presented him with my
reserve, which he emptied with much apparent satisfaction, and
returned the flask with thankfulness.&nbsp; Then resuming his
unwearying amusement, he never ceased until we reached the inn at
Corwen; not the principal one, but a <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>small house on the right of the
street opposite to the Owen Glyndwr; which latter has a gigantic
head over the door, much resembling the Saracen&rsquo;s of Snow
Hill notoriety.</p>
<p>I discovered the landlord of &ldquo;The Welsh Harp&rdquo; to
be the proprietor of the van, and that the driver was his
son.&nbsp; He also followed the occupation of watch and fishing
tackle maker, and I willingly, therefore, took up my quarters
with this specimen of Welsh rusticity, when invited, in
preference to quartering at the great inn with the great head, as
also did Mr. Whiffler.</p>
<p>The first question put to the jolly landlord, was, &ldquo;What
can you give us to eat?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was about three
o&rsquo;clock in the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, I have a nice roast duck and some peas, which
were intended for John&rsquo;s,&rdquo; meaning our van-driver,
&ldquo;dinner; but I shall be able to find something else for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how long, pray, will it be before it is
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, that will do; and, in the interim,
I&rsquo;ll borrow one of your coats, and we will visit the
church, if there is anything in it worth looking at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner said than done; and a large blue coat, with two
heavy capes, and brass buttons <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>of the size of crown pieces, was
immediately brought forth, which I slipped into, it fitting
me&mdash;like a sack!&nbsp; No matter&mdash;my own was thoroughly
drenched, and was hanging before a blazing fire in the kitchen,
reeking like a leg of mutton, hot from the boiler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to slip into a pair of my leather
breeches?&rdquo; inquired my hospitable host.</p>
<p>This I thankfully declined, upon looking at the difference of
our dimensions.&nbsp; My piping friend was comfortably seated in
the chimney corner, and observing &ldquo;that he had never
frequented church since he was married, having received at that
time a shock he could never recover,&rdquo; he commenced playing
the beautiful air of &ldquo;My ain fireside,&rdquo; whilst I,
turning most heroically to the right about, again braved the
&ldquo;pelting of the pitiless storm,&rdquo; accompanied by John,
our driver, who, in a few minutes, conducted me to the ancient
edifice.</p>
<p>On one side of the altar is the lid of a coffin, which has the
following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic jacet Jorweth Sulien, vicarius de
Corvaen ora pro eo.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the church wall is shewn the private doorway <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>through
which Owen Glyndwr entered the building whenever he attended
divine worship, and in the rock, which overhangs the churchyard,
there is a recess, which bears the name of Glyndwr&rsquo;s chair;
and the stone which now forms the lintel of the doorway leading
to his pew, is said to retain the mark of his dagger, half an
inch in depth, which he threw from the said chair; but upon what
occasion it is not stated.</p>
<p>In the churchyard is a range of building called Corwen
College, having over the archway the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Corwen College,<br />
For six widows of the Clergymen<br />
Of the church of England,<br />
Who died possessed of cures of souls,<br />
In the county of Merionethshire.<br />
Built and endowed<br />
A.D MDCCL by the legacy of<br />
William Egton Esq.<br />
Of Plas-warren.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the cemetery there is a cross, fixed in a circular stone,
westward of the steeple; and it is supposed that the name of
Corwen is a corruption of Corvaen, and derived from the
cross.&nbsp; Cor signifies a circle, and maen (which is likewise
<a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>considered to have been changed into vaen) if joined to
cor, means a cross in the circle.</p>
<p>Having satisfied my curiosity here, I returned to the public
house, and the first object which met my delighted eyes was the
promised duck, accompanied by a dish of most elegant trout; a
dainty for which I had been longing ever since I entered this
territory of rocks and torrents.&nbsp; My friend was already
placed at the table, and he clapped his hands, and rubbed them
with evident delight and satisfaction at seeing me arrive so
opportunely.&nbsp; The fish despatched, duck and green peas in
close column brought up the rear.&nbsp; But I and my gallant
comrade&mdash;a better trencherman ne&rsquo;er poised a
fork&mdash;attacked in line, cut up the one, and routed the
other, with the most determined bravery.&nbsp; The right and left
wings were attacked and cut off from the main body, which with
all its material we dispersed in the glorious conflict, remaining
masters of the field.</p>
<p>Although I thus warmly express my satisfaction at partaking of
this not easily-to-be-forgotten luxury, let me not be mistaken
for a gourmand; but a wet and tired traveller, however much his
mind may be enchanted by the scenery through which he passes,
never beholds a more delightful prospect than a comfortable meal
at his journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; It so happened, however, <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>that this
was not to be my journey&rsquo;s end, for a blaze of light darted
into the room at the moment John had carried off the spoils from
our field of battle, and the glorious orb of day shone forth in
cloudless majesty.</p>
<p>Wine in such a house, being out of the question, we ordered a
jug of warm punch, and having drank success to my musical friend
in a brimming goblet, I began to think, as my time was limited,
and his path lay towards Cerrig-y-Drudion, and mine towards Bala,
I had better reach that place before dark.&nbsp; My companion
having divested himself of his shoes and stockings, and adopted
those of the landlord, and feeling himself comfortable before the
fire, resolved upon remaining where he was until bedtime.&nbsp;
Wishing him, therefore, a pleasant evening, and a good
night&rsquo;s repose, I once more took the road for another walk
of ten miles; while I heard the shrill sounds of his fife stick
playing the Welsh air of &ldquo;Farewell Glanddyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the village, I was attracted by the eyes of the
prettiest little Welsh lass that I remember having seen in the
country.&nbsp; Health bloomed in her cheek, and animation darted
from her sloe-black eyes.&nbsp; She was talking to a village lad,
who appeared to be much abashed <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>by some reproof she had given him;
and presently, with a significant nod of the head and an
admonitory glance of the eye, she turned briskly from him, and
frisked by me, humming a Welsh air&mdash;the first that I had
heard since I entered the principality&mdash;while the youth,
with a smile and a sigh, turned in a contrary direction,
exclaiming, &ldquo;Ah, Jenny, if you refuse so many, you may
happen to pray for one yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I afterwards discovered that the Welsh air was called after
the mansion of Mr. Edward Jones, the compiler of that most
interesting book of Cambrian lore, the Bardic Museum.&nbsp; I
instantly determined to put the idea I had formed in my mind of
the Welsh lass into verse, and to adapt the lines to the music.
(See plate.) <a name="citation143"></a><a href="#footnote143"
class="citation">[143]</a></p>
<p>Every thing looked cheerful; the birds carroled joyously from
the trees and bushes; and I joined in the chorus.&nbsp; A robin
appeared to be much taken with my vocal powers, and for a good
while kept me company, alighting constantly some ten or twelve
yards before me, and listening attentively until I had passed as
far; then, passing me again in his flight, he took up his station
as before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor bird!&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;I
remember in my boyhood I have followed some of your race as
eagerly as you now follow me; and my ears drank in their notes,
intoxicating <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>my senses with delight.&nbsp; I shall never forget the
old mulberry tree that grew in our play grounds, shadowing a
pretty little hermitage in which I used to sit apart from my
schoolfellows and listen to the notes of that delightful warbler,
with whom I grew familiar, and fed every evening with crumbs of
bread, saved from my dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How extraordinary it appears that the past should always seem
more delightful than the present!&nbsp; I am convinced, that I
was more miserable during my school-boy days than I have been
since, and yet my mind returns to the brighter portions of the
picture only.&nbsp; The April beams that dried up the tears of my
youth live in the memory, while the clouds and showers are buried
in oblivion.&nbsp; Youth, youth!&mdash;why should we ever grow
old? why are we not as fresh and green at sixty as we are at
twenty?&mdash;why may we not enjoy the blessings of vigour, the
elastic bound, the rosy tint, the boundless flow of spirits, the
freshness of imagination, until the moment when we drop into the
grave?&mdash;But sentimentalism is a bad subject for sale, and
therefore I have no business to introduce any chapters of such a
nature in this little work.</p>
<p>At a short distance from Corwen, a road branches off to the
left, along which the traveller <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>should trudge to the village of
Llandrillo, and he will be repaid by the sight of one of the most
fertile valleys in Wales.&nbsp; It is a mile farther to Bala by
this route, but the superior beauty of the scenery will amply
recompense him for the extra distance; for, with the exception of
a view of Bala lake, obtained from an eminence on the road, which
runs along the opposite side of the valley, it is dull and
uninviting.&nbsp; But, on the contrary, by the Llandrillo route,
the eye is delighted with a succession of scenes, varied and
interesting in the extreme.&nbsp; Huge masses of rock hang over
the road, upon the left, in threatening grandeur, while waving
woods, and falling streams, give endless variety to the
picture.</p>
<p>After proceeding four miles, I crossed a bridge over a fine
trout stream, the banks of which are shaded with trees; and,
turning into an avenue upon the right, seated myself by the
margin of the brook, secured from the hot rays of the mid-day
sun, and fancied myself the melancholy Jacques.&nbsp; There only
wanted a wounded stag, to make the illusion perfect.</p>
<p>Here I was shortly after joined by an old man and his son,
who, after some hours&rsquo; fishing, had contrived to fill a
moderately sized basket with very fine trout.&nbsp; The father
was tall and thin, with prominent features, sharp grey eyes, and
<a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>grey
locks; his port was erect, &ldquo;stiff as a ramrod,&rdquo; and
if he had been unfortunate enough to have had a lame leg, he
would have made an excellent representation of Corporal
Foss.&nbsp; The son, a youth of about nineteen, was clad in a
suite of clothes so tattered, that my curiosity was excited to
learn at which rent he got into them.&nbsp; His fishing basket
was slung at his back, and his rod was composed of odds and ends;
his hat, from long exposure to the weather, had lost its crown,
while the rim was torn into ribands.&nbsp; If ever the god of
love assumed the disguise of ragged poverty, he could not have
chosen a better model, both in person and attire.&nbsp; His
height was about five feet, nine inches; his face a perfect oval;
his hair, which stole in clustering curls from beneath its
wretched covering, was of the brightest auburn; his forehead was
broad and high; his eyebrows finely arched, and his dark blue
eyes were lighted up with the fire of animation; his nose, teeth,
and chin were perfectly beautiful; his neck and shoulders would
be invaluable to a sculptor; and his whole graceful frame seemed
formed for strength and activity.&nbsp; His demeanour was
respectful and modest, and the contrast between the noble
creature and his sorry garb was painfully striking.&nbsp; There
was, however, a look of <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>independence and a freedom in his
gait, which suited well with the surrounding scene.</p>
<p>The old man seated himself near me, and lamented that he could
not obtain any fire to light his pipe.&nbsp; This element I
quickly supplied him with, and, lighting a cigar for myself, we
resembled a knot of Indian warriors smoking &ldquo;the calumet of
peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; I entered into conversation, offering my
flask, by way of making a favourable impression.&nbsp; They
thankfully availed themselves of my offer, and my expectations
were not disappointed.&nbsp; The old man told me that he had been
a soldier in his youth, and fought in many battles, both in Egypt
and Spain, and was now in the receipt of a pension from
government, for honourable wounds, which at various times he had
received in the service of his country.</p>
<p>While his father whiffed his tobacco, the youth angled down
the stream, but soon returned and, respectfully and gracefully
declining my invitation to renew his draught, he stood looking
down upon us, his arms folded across his chest, embracing his
rod, and listening modestly to the old man&rsquo;s
narration.&nbsp; I sat an hour with these two beings, and, having
purchased a casting line and some flies from the elder fisherman,
he put two extra ones into my hands, saying: <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>&ldquo;There, sir, are two flies, with which I killed
some fine trout, yesterday.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make you a present
of them; and, when you are killing your fish, perhaps
you&rsquo;ll think of the old soldier.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, with
mutual thanks, we parted.</p>
<p>As I entered the village of Llandrillo, I was much delighted
with the lively scene.&nbsp; The long street was crowded with
peasantry, in their holiday clothes.&nbsp; On each side were
stalls, formed of tubs turned upside down, and boards placed upon
them, to support their merchandise; square patches strewed with
straw and covered with crockery and glass; tables well stored
with woollen hose and mittens; and stands of gingerbread and
ginger-pop were liberally stationed in different quarters, to
gratify and refresh the happy throng.&nbsp; At times, a sudden
opening in the crowd took place, the whole mass of people jamming
each other upon either side of the street, to make way for a
trotting pony, or an ambling nag, to curvet and prance down the
middle and up again, to show his paces.&nbsp; At the upper end of
the fair, a hardware man harangued a crowd of people from his
travelling warehouse (a covered cart,) endeavouring to persuade
them that he came to Llandrillo solely for their benefit, and for
no selfish motive upon earth, and labouring to convince them, in
<a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>brazier-like eloquence, that the articles he offered to
their notice were considerably under prime cost, and could not be
purchased elsewhere for treble the money;&mdash;but, though he
sold at a great sacrifice to himself, he begged them not to
consider his loss, but their own gain; such an opportunity would
never again present itself, therefore now was their only time to
buy cheap!</p>
<p>A party of Welsh girls attracted my attention, gathered
together in front of a wall, upon which a line of men&rsquo;s
hats were ranged, of various qualities and prices; and great glee
and laughter were elicited, as each fitted the new beaver upon
her head, it being considered the ne plus ultra of taste, and a
powerful auxiliary to the coquetry of a Welsh girl.</p>
<p>Leaving Llandrillo, and proceeding towards Bala, the traveller
enters the</p>
<h3>VALE OF EDEYRNION.</h3>
<p>The mountains here, upon either side, are covered with
plantations, and the beautiful Dee winds gracefully in the centre
of the valley, through delightful meadows, while corn fields wave
upon the sloping banks, and everything presents to the eye the
appearance of freshness <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>and fertility, cheerfulness and
content.&nbsp; At the bridge near Llandderfel, a small village,
which is first observed upon the opposite bank of the Dee, a
splendid view presents itself.&nbsp; The river here is broad,
shallow, and deep, by turns, and looking up or down the vale, its
meandering sportiveness charms the eye.&nbsp; At the extremity of
the valley is a lofty mountain, planted to the summit, which
seems so closely to envelop it, as to prevent all egress.&nbsp;
To stand upon this bridge at sunset, and listen to the whistle of
the sheep boy as he trudges merrily along the road, the song of
the husbandman, or the joyous laugh of the milkmaids&mdash;sounds
that float upon the silent air for miles, at such an
hour,&mdash;the twittering of the birds, before they hide their
heads beneath their wings to seek repose&mdash;the low craik of
the rail, amidst the corn&mdash;and sweeter than all, the music
of the river, discharging liquid sounds from its transparent
bosom,&mdash;creates a sensation which we are at a loss how to
express.&nbsp; Excess of pleasure becomes painful; and,
overpowered with delight, nature asserts her influence, and we
experience the luxury of tears!&mdash;at least, I did, and I pity
from my soul the man who is unfortunately incapable of a similar
feeling.</p>
<p>Passing through the little village of Llanver, <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>and
crossing a stream over the bridge close by the lodge of Mr. Price
of Rhewlas, I at length arrived at the Bull&rsquo;s Head in the
town, to which house I had been recommended by a passing
traveller; and, tired with my day&rsquo;s exertions, called for a
tea-dinner and slippers.</p>
<h3>BALA.</h3>
<p>Both these luxuries were furnished me by the fair hands of
Martha Jones, the landlady&rsquo;s unmarried sister, a lively,
black-eyed, pretty lass, who, in being a spinster, proves that
the Bala lads are greatly deficient in taste, or that Martha has
set her cap at something better than is to be found in Bala.</p>
<p>Two gentlemen were seated in the room when I entered, each of
whom were discussing the merits of a glass of brandy and
water.&nbsp; One of them (a young man who I afterwards discovered
was a captain&rsquo;s clerk in the East India service, upon
leave,) was making himself particularly entertaining to his
companion, by relating a number of anecdotes about a relative, a
clergyman, whose residence is somewhere in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! you remember the time when the dinner was
given at &mdash;; well, the old boy <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>as usual, had got too much grog
aboard, and without a rudder, began to crowd sail for the
stable&mdash;my eyes! how he did traverse! but at last, a gale
took his topsail right aback, and capsising him into the kennel,
he began to roar out for help.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter?&rsquo; cried twenty voices at a time.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh
help! help me up,&rsquo; cried the old boy, &lsquo;for I&rsquo;m
the Lord&rsquo;s servant!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay, ay,&rsquo;
cried one, &lsquo;and you&rsquo;re like all the rest of
&rsquo;em, want a good deal of looking after.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ha,
ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This anecdote, required another glass of brandy and water to
wash it down; which being brought, this irreverend humorist
rehearsed a number of other circumstances concerning his
eccentric relative, amongst which was a story of his ascending
the pulpit, to preach a sermon, &ldquo;and kneeling down,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;he placed his hand upon the cushion, in the
attitude of prayer, closed his port holes, and fell into
a&mdash;sound sleep!&nbsp; The congregation waited&mdash;and
waited&mdash;until their patience was quite exhausted, and one
after another began to heave anchor.&nbsp; The clerk, at last,
ventured to awaken his pastor just in time for him to see the
last of his parishioners leaving the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was truly sorry to find, upon inquiry, that this was but too
true a tale of the old man, <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>whose years are many, and who must
be well aware, that a very short time can elapse, before he will
become a tenant of the grave.</p>
<p>Wearied with the conversation, I rang for my bed candle, and
retired to rest.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning, I found
myself unable to walk, from the effect produced by a sprained
ancle, and I had the delightful prospect of being confined to the
room of an inn in a country town, without a being to converse <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>with, or a
book to enliven me; but my kind landlord, a fine portly,
rosy-cheeked, round-headed, honest-hearted Boniface, as ever drew
spigot, kindly offered me a pony, to take me to the lake, which,
he said, contained plenty of perch.&nbsp; This offer, I
thankfully accepted, and, by the aid of mine host and his ostler,
was soon seated upon the back of a quiet
not-to-be-put-out-of-his-way animal, as any clerical gentleman
could desire to ride upon, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With slow and solemn pace,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>proceeded to catch fish, and view the scenery around</p>
<h3>LLYN TEGID, OR BALA LAKE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p155b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Bala Lake"
title=
"Bala Lake"
 src="images/p155s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Seated upon a rock that projects into the lake (under the
shadow of which is the boat house of Mr. Price, of Rhewlas, of
whom, more anon) I commenced my solitary pastime; but my eyes
continually wandered from the float, to the surrounding scenery,
which is of a pleasing rather than an imposing nature.&nbsp; The
lake was slightly ruffled by a refreshing breeze, which
fortunately sprang up, and prevented me from dissolving in the
heat of the sun.&nbsp; It is about four miles in length, and in
some parts it is forty yards <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>in depth.&nbsp; The shores are
sloping, the soil gravelly, and delightfully variegated with
plantations of trees and shrubs.&nbsp; Towards the head of the
lake, the mountains are upon a very grand scale, and rival
Snowdon in their altitude; <i>Arran Fowddwy</i> is the loftiest
of these, near the summit of which, upon its eastern side,
beneath a huge crag, is situated a lake, which affords excellent
sport to the angler, although the fish are not of the finest
quality.</p>
<p><i>Arrenig Vawr</i>, (or great), which is nearly as lofty as
Arran Fowddwy, and rises upon the N.W. side of the Llyn, has also
a lake, containing trout of a large size, which are noted for
rejecting the artificial fly; but, about half way up the
<i>Arrenig V&acirc;ch</i>, (or little) is a lake, which when a
light breeze sweeps along its surface, will amply reward the
angler for his trouble, in reaching it.&nbsp; A morning, and an
evening, at each of these places, enable me to state thus much,
for the benefit of the disciples of Isaac Walton.</p>
<p>I was suddenly aroused from a dream of pleasure, which I was
enjoying, with my eyes open, by a tug at my line, reminding me,
that a fish had swallowed the hook.&nbsp; After a little
coquetting, which lovers usually make use of, I brought it to my
arms, and then thrust it into <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>my bag; a fine perch!&nbsp; I now
resolved, to begin in earnest, and in an hour, by my temptation
and insinuation, contrived to obtain a very handsome dish, with
which I returned upon my pony to the inn, resigning them and
myself to the care of Martha Jones.&nbsp; This was the only
uncomfortable evening I passed at the Bull&mdash;and with respect
be it spoken, all my uneasiness was occasioned, by the
magistrates of the county, who had met to discuss the important
business of their various districts, and to join in the</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Feast of dainties and the flow of
port.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the while, the honest landlord, who resembled a
&ldquo;turtle on his hind fins,&rdquo; waddled about in high
glee.&nbsp; It was a great day for the Bull&rsquo;s Head! and his
joy resembled Dennis Bulgruddery&rsquo;s, of the Red Cow, when he
saw a traveller on the heath, walking in the direction of his
long neglected hostelry.&nbsp; The confusion of sounds distracted
my brain, and I was almost tempted to exclaim, in the language of
Falstaff,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Is hell broke loose?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, remembering that it was occasioned, <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>by a
meeting of magistrates, my reverence for the laws, and the
distributors of them, made me place my disabled foot upon a
chair, &ldquo;like patience on a monument, smiling at
grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was informed that Mr. Price was among the assembly, to whom,
through the kindness of Mr. W&mdash;, I had a letter of
introduction.&nbsp; My accident, however, would prevent my dining
with the party, and I concluded it would be better to wait until
the ensuing morning, to pay my respects to him.&nbsp; A couple of
ducks, with green peas, and a pint of pale sherry, assisted to
restore my good humour; and, after poring over the pages of an
old magazine, till the book became a pillow for my head, I had my
foot dressed and resigned myself to the influence of
Morpheus.&nbsp; My bed room window (the blinds of which, I had
neglected to pull down, before I retired to bed) permitted the
full blaze of the morning sun to shine upon my slothful pillow,
and rouse me from my slumber.&nbsp; A great fault, in all the
Welsh inns, is that Morpheus seems to have complete and
undisputed prevalence over the whole household.&nbsp; After
satisfying myself that I could walk across the room, I thought I
would endeavour to see something more of the town, and stroll
about, until such time as breakfast could be prepared.&nbsp; I
accordingly <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>dressed, put on the spacious slippers I had been
provided with on the previous night, took a strong ash stick in
my hand, by way of crutch, and hobbled into the pure air.</p>
<p>The town of Bala consists of one long street, has about 2500
inhabitants, and is celebrated for its manufacture of woollen
articles, such as stockings, gloves, and, formerly, Welsh
wigs.&nbsp; Upon an eminence at the S. E. end of the town, the
old women and young girls assemble in considerable numbers during
the summer months, to pursue their industrious avocations in the
open air.&nbsp; The mound is called, <i>Tommen y Bala</i>; it is
said to be of Roman construction; and, from the summit, a very
fine view may be obtained of Llyn Tegid and the mountains.&nbsp;
There is a town hall, and a chapel of ease to the parish church
at Llanycil, about a mile distant, where the morning service is
read in English only upon the first Sunday in each month.&nbsp;
Finding my exertion too great for my ease, I was glad to hobble
into the shop of the village apothecary and surgeon.&nbsp; It was
half past eight o&rsquo;clock, and the drowsy shop boy, who
appeared but recently to have left his bed, informed me, that
perhaps his master would be down in a short time.&nbsp; This
indefinite period did not suit my patience, and I requested him
<a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>to give
his master a call.&nbsp; Still he came not.&nbsp; I became
fidgetty, and began to be indignant, half resolving to leave the
shop, when a little, stiff, consequential looking personage made
his appearance, gazing upon me with a look in which much
dissatisfaction was manifest.&nbsp; My travelling garb (for I had
not discarded my shooting jacket, at this early hour, in favour
of a more appropriate morning costume) did not inspire him with
much suavity; but, after a minute survey, he, with all the
dignity of five feet, pointed to a chair, which I a short time
before had quitted to look at some maps that adorned the walls of
the room, I bared my ancle for his inspection, and he informed me
truly, that rest alone could be of service to me.&nbsp; With this
comfortable advice, which I had previously determined not to
follow, I returned to the inn, breakfasted, ordered out the pony,
and set off to visit Mr. Price, of Rhewlas.</p>
<p>A handsome gateway opens into the grounds of Rhewlas; a neat
lodge is situated upon the right of the avenue, and upon the
left, a fine mountain stream dashes over its black, rocky
bed.&nbsp; Half way up the avenue, upon the right, is a beautiful
dingle, over which a bridge is thrown for the accommodation of
passengers, and under it a murmuring rill, glides on its course
to the principal <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>stream.&nbsp; A profusion of rhododandrums, of a kind,
are interspersed amongst the trees, and shrubs, forming a
delightful contrast.&nbsp; Here the noble oak, the beech, and
birch, flourish luxuriously in common with the other numerous
leafy tenants of the forest, whose ever varying hues delight the
eye.</p>
<p>The house is situated on a rising ground, backed by the
mountain and extensive woods, and commands a noble prospect.</p>
<p>After dinner, I accompanied Mr. Price in his phaeton, to take
a survey of the estate, and was much delighted with the evident
pleasure he took, in improving the roads in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Under his auspices, a new line of road is
joined to Corwen, which, although deficient in picturesque
beauty, is shorter by one mile than that by Llandrillo, and
affords far better travelling.</p>
<p>Mr. Price has planted, during his residence at this lovely
spot, no less than 650 acres, and the domain altogether presents
a picture of beauty and happiness, seldom to be met with.&nbsp;
He is much respected; is a magistrate, and a resident; and, in
consequence, knows the value of his land.&nbsp; He considers, and
administers to the wants of his tenants, and, instead of
extorting from them a rent they would be compelled <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>to starve
themselves to pay, he limits it to a sum which will enable them
to live in comfort.</p>
<p>It was twilight when I left Rhewlas, and by the side of the
dingle I have before mentioned, I paused to gaze once more upon
the beauty of the scene, and traced a few lines, expressive of my
feelings, upon quitting so delightful a solitude.</p>
<blockquote><p>Farewell to fair Rhewlas! and farewell to thee,<br
/>
Thou pride of the vallies, thou fast flowing Dee!<br />
Whose stream glides in brightness from Bala&rsquo;s fair
breast,<br />
And wanders in beauty through regions of rest.<br />
Farewell to thee, Rhewlas! how blest were my lot,<br />
With friends round and near me, the gay world forgot,<br />
Here, here, in the soft lap of quiet to dwell,<br />
Farewell to thee Rhewlas! sweet Rhewlas, farewell!</p>
<p>The bright golden summer hath fill&rsquo;d thee with
glee&mdash;<br />
The song of the thrush, and the boom of the bee,<br />
The wild flowers&rsquo; fragrance, the breath of the rose,<br />
And green woods that kiss the dark stream as it flows:<br />
To scenes grand and gloomy my footsteps may stray,<br />
Where terror frowns dreadful along the wild way,<br />
But beauty for aye in this region shall dwell,<br />
Farewell to thee, Rhewlas! sweet Rhewlas, farewell!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I returned to the inn, much pleased with my day&rsquo;s
entertainment, happy to find that my ancle was comparatively
easy, and ordered a <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>car to be ready on the following
morning to convey me ten miles on the road to Dolgelly.</p>
<p>Rising early, I found no inconvenience from my ancle; and,
after a good breakfast, took leave of my host, and his wife, of
Martha Jones, and the Bull&rsquo;s Head, all of whom appeared
anxious to see me comfortably seated in the vehicle, and with
kindest farewells, expressed a desire of speedily seeing me
again&mdash;all excepting the Bull&rsquo;s Head, poor thing,
which being a dummy only looked a good bye; and taking every
thing into consideration, he looked it very well.</p>
<p>The car in which I was bumped along the road, in every respect
resembled those delightful conveyances that rattle the astonished
traveller from Cork to Blarney.&nbsp; It is a sort of oval box,
placed upon two wheels, with a door behind, and with good wedging
will contain four persons; but being springless and cushionless,
the passenger is jolted to his heart&rsquo;s content, that is, if
his heart has been set on jolting; and, without doubt, it is fine
exercise for persons of sedentary habits, if by any chance, their
bones happen to escape dislocation.&nbsp; My knapsack (my
opposite, and only fellow passenger) and I, looked very black at
each other, as we bobbed up and down, like a cockney
grocer&rsquo;s apprentice upon a high trotting horse; but I soon
became resigned, and my <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>knapsack having shifted its berth
for the bottom of the vehicle, seemed to rest more comfortably
than on the seat.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the inconvenience I
suffered from this carriage, I could not help admiring the
extreme beauty of the lake, as we pursued our course along its
borders; sometimes, only catching a glimpse of it, through the
trees that shaded its delightful margin.&nbsp; Its waters were
smooth and motionless; not a ripple was visible upon its surface;
the lofty mountains reflected in its breast gave a sombre tinge
to the otherwise golden scene, and, as I looked into the clear
depths of the shadows, I thought, how peacefully one shattered by
the storms of life might sink beneath, and be at rest!</p>
<p>After passing Llanthyn, (an estate belonging to Sir W. W.
Wynn, who claims the whole fishing of this beautiful piece of
water, and has, by putting a quantity of pike therein, destroyed
all the trout and gwynniad with which it once abounded), the
scenery became wild, and cheerless, until we reached</p>
<h3>THE VALE OF DRWSTYNRNT,</h3>
<p>where, to my great satisfaction, the car stopped at the sign
of the Welsh Prince, a distance of ten miles from Bala, and eight
from Dolgelly.&nbsp; <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>Being thoroughly tired with my ride,
I thought I would endeavour to obtain the proper use of my limbs,
and rest myself by walking the remainder of the journey.&nbsp;
Dismissing the car, therefore, and strapping my knapsack to my
shoulders, I once more took the road.</p>
<p>About a mile beyond the Welsh Prince, the valley becomes truly
beautiful.&nbsp; Waving woods adorn the mountains upon either
side.&nbsp; The Wnion here begins to be an important stream; and,
though in its course towards Dolgelly it is swelled by numerous
mountain tributaries into a broad river, the trees upon its banks
form an impenetrable screen, which conceal it from the traveller,
and its hoarse murmur, as it dashes over the rocks that vainly
endeavour to intercept its way, alone remind him of its
vicinity.&nbsp; At length, I arrived at a spot, where a road
leads over a bridge to the opposite side of the river.&nbsp;
Thinking this would be a proper place to see the Wnion to
advantage, I advanced to the centre of the bridge.&nbsp; The
effect is beautiful; hanging woods adorn the banks of the stream,
lofty ash trees, (around the trunks of which the ivy winds itself
in snakelike folds, feeding upon the tree that supports it),
spread their proud heads above, and form a pleasing shade, while
below the river roars, as it is precipitated beneath the <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>arch in two
large falls, that form a deep pool on the opposite side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in that pool,&rdquo; said a voice at my
shoulder, &ldquo;that Hugh Evans first saw the
fairy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon turning round, I saw an old man, much
bent with age, knitting hose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fairy, my good man?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and who
was Hugh Evans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you are a stranger here, sir.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s
a tale my grandfather used to tell me, of a lad, who worked with
him in the fields yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>HUGH EVANS, AND THE FAIRY.</h3>
<p>Hugh was a handsome lad, and all the girls were mad for love
of him; but he was a prudent youth, and would not notice any of
them, for he thought as he could hardly earn enough to support
himself, he had no chance of supporting others.&nbsp; Well, one
day as he was returning from work, he leant over the bridge,
where you are now standing, sir, and what should he see, but a
beautiful young creature, bathing in the deep water there.&nbsp;
Well, he knew it was a fairy, for he never had seen any thing
half so beautiful before; and he couldn&rsquo;t for the life of
him take his eyes from her, though she was as naked (saving your
presence) as when she was born.&nbsp; <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>She had long black hair, streaming
down her shoulders, as glossy as a crow&rsquo;s wing, and the
smallest feet, and hands, he ever beheld! and the beautiful fairy
said to him, &ldquo;Hugh, handsome Hugh, why did you come hither?
but, since you are here, turn your head aside, till I get out of
the stream, and then I&rsquo;ll come and talk to
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Hugh did as he was bid, for he was too much
in love to deny her any thing; and, before he could recover his
surprise, there was the fairy, close by his side, in the dress of
a neat country lass.&nbsp; And her snowy feet, and her raven
locks, red lips, and sparkling eyes, made Hugh&rsquo;s heart
knock at his ribs, like a smith&rsquo;s hammer on the
anvil.&nbsp; So what does he do, but drop down upon his knees,
and swore he was dying for love of the angel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no angel at all,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;but a
foolish body of a fairy, that has fallen in love with handsome
Hugh, and, if you&rsquo;ll consent to my wishes in one respect,
I&rsquo;ll be a fond wife to you all the days of your
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hugh was delighted to hear her talk, and he
promised to do every thing she wished.&nbsp; &ldquo;All I
desire,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is that you will permit me to
leave you every night at twelve o&rsquo;clock for one hour, and
never attempt to follow me, or ask where I have been.&nbsp; But,
if you follow me, you will never see me again, and you will only
<a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>have to
thank your own folly and rashness for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hugh
promised faithfully, and the fairy provided him with money enough
to buy a neat little cottage on the hill yonder, and to stock it
with a cow, pigs, and poultry.&nbsp; He likewise bought ten acres
of land, and every body wondered how Hugh Evans became so rich on
a sudden, but they supposed it was his wife&rsquo;s fortune,
though they never could find out who she was.&nbsp; For many
years they lived together, and she bore him two girls, both
resembling the mother, and their comeliness was the talk of the
country.&nbsp; Marriage had no power to destroy the beauty of the
fairy&rsquo;s form or face, for eternal youth and loveliness were
part of her portion.</p>
<p>But Hugh got jealous of a neighbour, whom he used to invite to
his house in the winter evenings, and he fancied that his wife
paid him more attention than was necessary.&nbsp; Until that
time, he never cared about her absence at midnight but the
&ldquo;green eyed monster;&rdquo; whispered to him that she had
other than honest motives, for absenting herself from home at
that late hour.&nbsp; And one night, when his neighbour, Davie
Jones, happened to be more animated than usual with the good
woman his hostess, who was always desirous of making Hugh&rsquo;s
friends welcome, he gave her a kiss at parting <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>that went
to the heart of poor Hugh; and he determined to look after her
that night when she left his bed, to discover if his suspicions
were well founded.&nbsp; Accordingly, pretending to sleep, he
watched his wife when she rose up.&nbsp; The first thing she did
was to go to her children, whom she kissed, and by the light of
the moon, which shone brightly through the casement, he saw her
suddenly (without the aid of toilet labour) arrayed in a gossamer
robe of rose coloured pink, through which her beautiful skin was
dimly perceptible, and her exquisite form fully displayed to his
astonished eyes; the right arm and breast were bare, while the
drapery was secured upon the left shoulder, and at the waist with
clasps of costly gems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her black luxuriant ringlets, contrasted with her snowy
neck, her dark eyes flashing with delight, and her red pouting
lips,&rdquo; said poor Hugh, &ldquo;made me motionless with
admiration, which was increased by seeing her leap, through the
open casement!&nbsp; Terrified lest she should be dashed to
pieces by the fall&mdash;filled with fury at her being thus
decked out to meet her paramour, with desperate eagerness I
darted out of the window in pursuit.&nbsp; The height was
considerable.&nbsp; I caught a glimpse in my descent, of her
fairy form as she reached the summit <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>of the hill, and then all sense
forsook me.&nbsp; When restored to consciousness, I found myself
stretched upon my bed; both my legs broken by the fall, and my
head sorely bruised.&nbsp; Upon asking for Lleucu, my wife, I was
told she had never been seen since I beheld her.&nbsp; My friend
Davie was attending me affectionately, bathing my temples with
cold lotions; and my heart smote me for my suspicions.&nbsp;
Night came, and, as the hour approached when Lleucu departed, I
became restless and feverish, when a voice, which I knew to be
Lleucu&rsquo;s, entered my chamber; it sang as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Farewell Hugh, handsome Hugh,<br />
Don&rsquo;t forget thy poor Lleucu!<br />
O&rsquo;er thy limbs I spread a charm,<br />
And to-morrow, free from harm,<br />
To thine honest labour hie,<br />
To support our progeny.<br />
Oh, protect their tender years,<br />
Bless my hopes and soothe my fears!<br />
Farewell, Hugh, handsome Hugh,<br />
Don&rsquo;t forget thy poor Lleucu!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I would have given my life to have seen her
again,&rdquo; continued Hugh; &ldquo;but I lost her for
ever.&nbsp; The next morning, faithful to her promise, I was
indeed perfectly free from pain; my limbs were as strong as at
the moment when I <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>sprang from the window; but my heart was
broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be, sir, you&rsquo;d like to buy a pair of
stockings or mittens,&rdquo; said the old man, without pausing to
notice the effect his tale had upon me, and pulling the articles
out of his coat pocket as he spoke.&nbsp; I could not resist the
appeal, and, giving him the price he demanded, I pursued my
journey towards Dolgelly.&nbsp; Nearly the whole of this lovely
valley is the property of Sir Robert Vaughan.</p>
<p>I was meditating upon the romantic tale of the old man, when
suddenly a turn in the road and an opening in the dell revealed
to my delighted eyes the celebrated mountain called Cader
Idris.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<h3>CADER IDRIS,</h3>
<p>the loftiest mountain in Merionethshire, and the second in
North Wales, is said to be 950 yards in perpendicular height from
Dolgelly Green.&nbsp; Cader Idris literally means
&ldquo;Idris&rsquo;s chair,&rdquo; where he is supposed to have
studied astrology; and Idris is a name attributed to Enoch, the
founder of astronomy.&nbsp; Mr. Edward Jones, to whom the public
are indebted for his learned and ingenious work, entitled
&ldquo;The Bardic Museum,&rdquo; observes that &ldquo;C&aelig;r
<a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>Idris
implies the city of the learned:&rdquo; and Mr. Rowland, in his
&ldquo;Mona Antiqua,&rdquo; mentions a place in Anglesea called
C&aelig;r Idris, also B&ocirc;d Idris, or &ldquo;Idris&rsquo;s
abode or mansion,&rdquo; in Yale, Denbighshire, which still
retains the name, as well as that of Ll&ecirc;ch Idris, or
&ldquo;the shelter of Idris,&rdquo; a farm so called, at
Trawsoynydd in Merionethshire, which also may imply the grave of
Idris.&nbsp; Idris is supposed to have flourished in the third or
fourth century, and his genealogy from an old manuscript, runs
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Idris Gawr ab Gwyddno, ab Tibion, ab Cunedda
Wledig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snowdon and Cader Idris were formerly supposed to be the
Parnassian hills of Wales, and none but good bards could claim so
elevated a seat.</p>
<p>Idris, the champion or bard, invented the harp; or, if the
Gomerian Britons brought that instrument into the country when
they first inhabited the island, it seems to have been lost and
forgotten; for Idris is said to have invented something similar;
but it is probable he only made some improvement on the ancient
harp, or perhaps his superior skill in performing on it might
have gained him that reputation.&nbsp; From all that can be
gathered from tradition, he was a learned man, an astrologer, and
a bard; and it <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>is likely that the summit of this mountain was chosen
by him, to examine from thence the movements of the heavenly
bodies, to write his inspired verses, or to frame laws for the
government and benefit of his country.</p>
<p>The walk from this spot to Dolgelly is exceedingly beautiful;
and as the tourist approaches the town before crossing the bridge
which is flung over the river Mawddach, a sign of some importance
attracts his attention upon the right: it runs thus:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">R. PUGH,<br />
Guide General<br />
To the Waterfalls, Cader Idris,<br />
And all the curious scenery in<br />
The vicinity of Dolgelly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">N.B.&nbsp; Licenced to let saddled
horses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>DOLGELLY,</h3>
<p>or Dolgellen, the Dale of the Hazel, is the principal market
town in Merionethshire, and the assizes are held here,
alternately with Bala.&nbsp; The town hall, the most important
building, is a neat stone edifice, erected in the year 1825, and
cost &pound;3000.&nbsp; It is built near the banks of the river
Wnion, (pronounced Oonion) and the <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>court room is fitted up with every
necessary accommodation for the officers of justice.&nbsp; In the
hall is a very fine portrait of Sir R. W. Vaughan, Bart., painted
by Sir M. A. Shee, F.R.A.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p174b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Parliament House of Owen Glyndwr"
title=
"Parliament House of Owen Glyndwr"
 src="images/p174s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Part of an old building, called &ldquo;Cwrt Pl&acirc;s yn-y
Dr&ecirc;v,&rdquo; or the Town-hall Court is still remaining,
amongst a range of wretched hovels, at the back of the post
office, in which a parliament was held by Owen Glyndwr.&nbsp; The
county jail at the outskirts of the town is of a semicircular
form, built of stone, and was erected in 1811, at an expense of
&pound;5000.</p>
<p>St. Mary&rsquo;s Church is a neat limestone edifice, of
Grecian architecture, with a handsome tower, and an expansive
nave.&nbsp; In it is an ancient monument of an armed knight, who
is represented in a suit of mail, helmet, a neck guard, a sword
in his hand, and a dog at his feet; a lion passant gardant is on
his shield, upon which is inscribed: &ldquo;Hic jacet Mauric
Filius Ynyr Vychan.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a modern one lately
erected to the memory of Baron Richards.</p>
<p>The town is celebrated for a manufacture of coarse woollen
cloths and flannels, called webs.&nbsp; The old town hall is used
for various purposes; English church service is performed there
every other Sunday; it is also used as a national <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>school, and
children are there taught to sing the church psalms.&nbsp; It is
likewise known as the theatre, and a Mr. Glover (son of Mrs.
Glover, of the London theatres) is the manager.&nbsp; It is kept
open sometimes for two months successively; admittance to boxes
2<i>s</i>, pit 1<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>Those fond of fine scenery should ascend the mountain from the
north side of the vale, to obtain the best view of the town, as
it lies sheltered at the foot of the majestic Cader Idris, which
rears its lofty shoulders in the clouds.</p>
<p>Clustering woods adorn the opposite range of mountains, as
they slope in irregular masses westward to the ocean; and in the
midst may be distinguished the residences of Mr. Reveley and
Captain Anwyl.</p>
<p>The river beautifully meandering through the green meadows,
the solemn quietude that prevails around, disturbed only by the
sound of the church clock, marking the progress of the fleeting
hours with lengthened tone, which, like the music of another
world, sweeps through the enchanting vale, combine to render this
a place where those not wedded to routs, masquerades, gambling
and licentiousness, might wish to live and die.</p>
<p>Dolgelly contains several good inns, of which the most
frequented are the Golden lion, the <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>Angel and the Ship.&nbsp;
Comfortable lodgings may likewise be obtained, at a cheap rate,
by those who desire to remain in the neighbourhood for the
purpose of making excursions to the falls, Kymmer Abbey, and
Nannau Park, the fishing stations, Dol y Gamedd on the Avon, Llyn
Cregenan, Llyn Gador, Llyn Geirw, Tal y llyn, &amp;c. <a
name="citation176"></a><a href="#footnote176"
class="citation">[176]</a></p>
<h3>DOLUWCHEOGRYD,</h3>
<p>the residence of Mr. Roland Williams, is delightfully situated
on the side of a mountain rising from this vale.&nbsp; I have
read of a man who made search through the world for true
hospitality, and returned to his cell without finding it.&nbsp;
It is certain that he never entered the abode of Mr. R. Williams,
which is the habitation of unaffected kindness, unpresuming
intelligence, and unostentatious hospitality&mdash;the retreat of
peace, love and friendship, where the stranger is received with
warmth and cordiality, his wants anxiously anticipated and
administered to, where the cheerful glass is rendered doubly
valuable by the accompaniment of a hearty welcome, and where the
administering hands of the fair inmates render every species of
generosity doubly dear to the favoured individual <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>who is
admitted into that happy sanctuary.&nbsp; The only feeling of
regret I experienced while at Doluwcheogryd was occasioned by the
necessity of leaving it so soon.</p>
<p>The tourist should not quit Dolgelly without visiting the
waterfalls, which, after heavy rains, are very magnificent.&nbsp;
As I was still suffering from the severe sprain, I was
accommodated by Mr. Williams, who also obliged me with his
company, with a very fine horse to carry me to the falls; and
bold and sure-footed, he performed his duty nobly, in spite of
crags, cliffs, hills and hollows.</p>
<p>Passing the house of Miss Madock, daughter of the late William
Alexander Madock, Esq., we came to the cataract.</p>
<h3>THE RHAIADR DU</h3>
<p>is situated in the grounds belonging to this lady, called
D&ocirc;l melynllyn.&nbsp; Here the torrent leaps from a height
of sixty feet over precipitous rocks, and plunges with a violence
that seems to shake the crags and trees around, into a deep pool,
from which it proceeds adown the dingle, over black and broken
fragments, to the river Mawddach.&nbsp; A footpath conducts the
tourist to the bottom of the falls, from which, stepping upon
some loose stones in the middle of the <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>stream, he
will obtain the best view of the cataract.&nbsp; A walk of about
three miles brings him to the falls of the Mawddach and Pistyll y
Cain, returning from which, he may visit Y Vanner, or Kymmer
Abbey, founded in 1198, by Meredith and Griffith, lords of
Merioneth, dedicated to St. Mary, and inhabited by monks of the
Cistertian order.&nbsp; It is not now, however, worthy of the
tourist&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; But Nannau Park, the seat of Sir
Robert William Vaughan, will afford much pleasure to those who
visit it.&nbsp; The grounds are thickly wooded, and the mansion
is supposed to occupy the highest ground of any residence in
Britain.&nbsp; The approach to it is five miles in length; it
stands 702 feet above the level of the sea; and the park is
celebrated for its venison.&nbsp; Previously to the year 1814,
there stood an oak in this park which bore a name terrible to the
ears of the peasantry: it was called</p>
<h3>DERWEN CEUBREN YR ELLYLL,</h3>
<p>which translated, means, &ldquo;the hollow oak, the haunt of
demons.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this oak, it is said Owen Glyndwr immured
the body of Howell Sele, the proprietor of this estate, who,
while they were walking together, treacherously shot an arrow at
the breast of Glyndwr, who, however, having <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>armour
beneath his doublet, fortunately received no hurt.&nbsp; The
cause of this treachery is said to have been the indignation
expressed by Owen at his kinsman&rsquo;s refusal to join his
cause to redress his country&rsquo;s wrongs.&nbsp; Glyndwr forced
his body into the hollow of this oak, most likely after having
slain him, where, forty years after this event, a skeleton was
discovered.&nbsp; The chieftain, after laying waste the mansion
and domain of Sele, hastened to join his friends.&nbsp; Sir W.
Scott has written a very beautiful poem upon this legend, which
will be found in the fifth note to his sixth canto of Marmion,
and is called the &ldquo;spirit&rsquo;s blasted
tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1813, this monarch of the wood fell to the
ground.</p>
<p>The country from Dolgelly to the mouth of the river is well
worth a journey of three hundred miles to visit, even though
there were no other objects worthy of notice in North Wales, and
will amply compensate the most eager researcher after the sublime
and beautiful.</p>
<p>At a turn of the coach road from a place called Te-gwyn, a
splendid view of Cader Idris is obtained, particularly in the
evening, when the mists arise from the numerous lakes in the
vicinity, like volumes of smoke from a domain of fire, curling in
fantastic forms around the mountain&rsquo;s waist, leaving its
summit stern and <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>clear in an unclouded sky&mdash;like a proud giant
surveying with disdain the dwarfish host of which he is the
leader.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thou mighty Cader, whose commanding head<br />
Is alway canopied with winter&rsquo;s snow,<br />
Whose form is rent in many a chasm dread,<br />
Adown whose sides the dashing torrents flow,<br />
And in primeval majesty still throw<br />
Their flakes of foam into the gulph below!<br />
Mine eyes dwell on thy terrors, and my heart<br />
Expands and trembles with a nameless glow!<br />
Wildest of all the mountain kind thou art,<br />
The rampart that protects old Cambria&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Land of the free! amid thy giant hills,<br />
Whose regal heads appear to prop the skies,<br />
Oh what a thrilling awe my bosom fills<br />
While gazing on thy dark sublimities!<br />
Mountains on mountains, peaks on peaks arise,<br />
Like tents belonging to some Titan race,<br />
Who choosing highest ground, nighest the God,<br />
Again defy the thunderer, face to face,<br />
From heights more vast than Alpine foot e&rsquo;er trod,<br />
And undismayed await his dreadful nod.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another noble view attracts attention, at a place called Glan
Mawddach&mdash;the broad arm of the sea, stretching for miles
between the rugged mountains, which, shrouded in veils of silvery
mist, fling their dark shadows into the depths of the
water.&nbsp; Proceeding onwards, the <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>seat of the late A. Wynne, Esq.,
called Athog, now the residence of Mr. Fowden, becomes
conspicuous upon the south side of the mouth of the Mawddach, and
beyond the extremity of the Bay Celylin point, and the church of
which the Rev. J. Parry is rector.&nbsp; The bishop has the power
of appointing a curate; but Mr. Parry retains the tithes to
himself.&nbsp; Arriving at</p>
<h3>BARMOUTH,</h3>
<p>the coach stopped at the Cors-y-gedol arms; but I proceeded to
the Commercial inn, where there is very good accommodation, and a
good look-out seaward.&nbsp; A warm bath of sea water refreshed
me; and by the star light I strolled upon the sands, which are
very hard and pleasant to walk upon, while my repast was
preparing at the inn.&nbsp; The night was calm and serene, and my
mind naturally adapted itself to the surrounding scene.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The brave o&rsquo;erhanging firmament&mdash;the majestical
roof fretted with golden fire,&rdquo; appeared to me far from
being &ldquo;a foul and pestilent congregation of
vapours.&rdquo;&nbsp; My soul took wing, and bounded from star to
star, leaping the realms of space, and plunging into infinity,
till wearied with its immeasurable flight, it resought its
earthly tenement, and my <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>body, which it left immoveable, as
if transformed to marble, resumed its functions.&nbsp; The low
moan of the ocean swam on my ear, like heavenly music.&nbsp; A
light breeze brought with it delicious freshness; and, as I
looked towards the land, all seemed as quiet as the abode of
peace.&nbsp; The lights from the houses had a pleasing effect, as
they streamed through the windows, row above row, under and upon
the side of the overhanging cliffs.</p>
<p>I returned to &ldquo;mine inn,&rdquo; and my meal being
despatched, retired to bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barmouth</span>, or Aber-Maw, derives its
name from being situated at the embouchure of the river Maw or
Mawddach, which at the entrance is obstructed <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>by a
bar.&nbsp; The old town, viewed from the sea, resembles a
fortress of some strength, hanging immediately over the
sands.&nbsp; In most cases a lofty situation is an advantage, but
here it is the reverse; for so steep is the side of the cliff on
which it stands, that the inhabitants of the upper regions are
completely smoke-dried from the chimneys of all the dwellings
beneath.</p>
<p>The new town stands at the base of the rock, and but for some
mounds of sand, that appear likely to grow into mountains by the
influence of the winds and waves, would inevitably be washed away
by the spring tides.&nbsp; Some of the fishermen&rsquo;s
habitations on the beach are at times buried in the drifting
sands; and, after a strong wind from the seaward, the inhabitants
generally labour hard to clear the obstruction from their
doors.</p>
<p>Barmouth had few visitors during my stay, and from the report
of those I met with, is greatly decreasing in popularity, which
says but little in favour of the lovers of fine scenery.&nbsp;
When the tide is at full, the panorama around the estuary cannot
be surpassed in beauty.&nbsp; The majestic river winds amongst
rocks, clad with purple heather, or projecting in barren
grandeur, that lift their jagged summits tier over tier, and peak
overtopping peak, while still tremendous, towering <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>over all,
the lofty Idris looms in the back ground.&nbsp; Green hills and
woody promontories, forests that stretch into the dark recesses
of the mountains, villas and copsewood glens, give an endless
variety to the romantic scene.</p>
<p>The town contains about 2,000 inhabitants, and there is a
manufactory of flannels and woollen stockings.</p>
<p>At noon, as I was basking upon the sands, or Friar&rsquo;s
island, which is situated at the mouth of the river, I had the
pleasure to see my new acquaintance and friend gallop into the
town, and old Charon having ferried me from the island to the
main land once more, I hastened to welcome him, as fast as my
damaged limb would suffer me.&nbsp; He proposed driving me to
Mostyn Hall, the seat of the Hon. E. M. L. Mostyn; which being
agreed to, I ordered dinner to be ready at our return, and we
started.&nbsp; The drive upon the Harlech road is bleak; upon the
right, the hills are barren; and seaward, beneath the road, is an
extensive flat, consisting chiefly of bog land and far from
interesting.&nbsp; About a mile and a half from the town, stands
the church of Llan Aber, upon the extreme verge of a cliff which
overlooks the ocean.&nbsp; The Carnaervonshire mountains have a
fine effect stretching into the sea; of which the Rivals, <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>with their
lofty peaks, are noble objects in the distance.&nbsp; Following
the chain, the eye rests for a moment upon Garn Bodean, and in
the flat between it and Garn Madryn is the town of
Pwllhely.&nbsp; The chain is resumed at Rhew mountain, and
terminates at Aberdarron point, three leagues from which is
Bardsey Island, a conspicuous and interesting object; for there
dwelt the bards of old, amongst whom were numbered the fathers of
science, the national interpreters, musicians, and legislators,
priests, and princes of Cambria.&nbsp; With their oratory they
soothed the savage ignorance of mankind into civilization and
knowledge, and polished their minds with the powerful aid of
music and poetry.&nbsp; After the dreadful slaughter of the monks
of Bangor, those who survived took shelter upon this
island.&nbsp; A few ruined walls alone remain of the ancient
abbey; and the inhabitants, who do not exceed one hundred
persons, support themselves chiefly by fishing.</p>
<p>About three miles from Barmouth, upon the summit of the
mountain called Dinas Gortin, are the remains of a military
encampment, and near to the town there stood a tower, where it is
said the Earl of Richmond used to conceal himself, when he
visited his secret allies in this part of the country.</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Near
the military station, are the tombs of the celebrated men of
Ardudwy; who, in imitation of the Roman robbers, made an
excursion into Denbighshire, and overcoming the men, forcibly
tore the women from their families, and returned in triumph with
them to their own country.</p>
<p>But the men of Denbighshire, rallying, pursued the spoilers,
and overtaking them in the pass of Drws ardydwy, routed them with
great slaughter.&nbsp; But the infatuated women had by this time
conceived so extraordinary a passion for their violators, that
rather than survive their loss, or perhaps more probably, to
escape the fury of their former husbands, they drowned themselves
in a lake, which is called the pool of Morwynion.</p>
<p>About two miles further, a road up a steep ascent, conducted
us to a fine avenue of trees, through which we passed, and at the
termination of it came to a handsome gateway, called Pat Mawr,
which admitted us into the mansion of Cors y gedol, which has
nothing in it to interest the tourist.&nbsp; The interior of the
building is incommodious and inelegant.&nbsp; The drawing-room
contains a few wretched portraits and high-backed chairs; and the
rest of the apartments are meanly furnished.&nbsp; The only
object of interest <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>is a window, out of which the Earl of Richmond,
afterwards Henry VII, is said to have leaped, when a party of
Richard III&rsquo;s soldiers attempted to apprehend him; it is
called the king&rsquo;s window.</p>
<p>We returned to Barmouth by the sea shore, and, after a most
delightful drive upon Neptune&rsquo;s boundaries, arrived at the
inn, where the evening was passed in conviviality, tempered with
prudence, and sweetened by social and interesting
conversation.&nbsp; As I had determined upon proceeding to
Harlech the following day, my companion was resolved to make the
journey as agreeable as possible, and requesting me to forward my
knap-sack &amp;c., by the coach, informed me that he would be
ready to accompany me in the morning.&nbsp; Requesting him,
therefore, to be early at breakfast, we parted for the night.</p>
<p>After despatching a hasty meal next morning, the word was
given &ldquo;to horse and away.&rdquo;&nbsp; My old favourite who
bore me so gallantly to the black cataract, was again resigned to
my care, and I to his, gentle as a lamb, proud as a war horse and
agile as an antelope.&nbsp; I felt like an Arab, on his steed,
and I thought I could defy the winds to overtake me.&nbsp; We
proceeded once more to Mostyn Hall, which was the appointed spot
of rendezvous for a pic-nic party.&nbsp; Here I <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>had the
happiness of meeting some of the choicest flowers of the Welsh
Highlands.&nbsp; Youth, beauty, freedom, and innocence, beamed
from the laughing eyes and unsullied cheeks of our fair
companions.&nbsp; The &ldquo;how d&rsquo;ye do&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
&ldquo;glad to see you,&rdquo; &ldquo;fine morning,&rdquo;
&amp;c. &amp;c., being ended, we moved forward in a formidable
cavalcade.&nbsp; Mirth, wit and pleasure played on the lips and
sparkled in the eyes of the whole party; and the animals that
bore us seemed to partake of the general feeling, by pricking up
their glossy ears, and bounding over the rugged road with more
spirit than prudence.&nbsp; Much mirth was occasioned by the
opening of gates, and crossing of brooks.&nbsp; At length, the
party plunged into a beautiful wood.&nbsp; I paused upon an
eminence, to mark the effect as they descended; it was
picturesque in the extreme, as at intervals, through the
openings, I caught a partial glimpse of the troop, pursuing their
cheerful way down the steep path.&nbsp; Pleased with the sight, I
passed the party at a gallop, and arriving at the foot of the
hill, remained upon a bridge, close by the woodman&rsquo;s
cottage, which crosses a mountain stream, watching their
approach.</p>
<p>It was delightful to see them advancing one by one through the
thick foliage which hung on <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>either side of the path, and arching
over their heads.&nbsp; On arriving at the foot of the descent,
the party drew up, and, had an artist been among us, I am
confident he would have produced a picture, which, even on the
lifeless canvass, would have delighted the connoisseurs of
Somerset House.</p>
<p>The variety of costume, the colour of the horses, the general
sensation of delight which lighted up the features of the gay
group; the picturesque cottage and bridge, the broad rushing
stream, the waving woods, with now and then a glimpse of the
sterile mountains, peeping above the beautiful fertility, formed
a landscape which Salvator Rosa himself would have been delighted
to delineate.</p>
<p>Penetrating through a woody maze, a glen upon our right, and
huge wild masses of rock towering above our heads, we passed
Crafnant; a house situated in the deep shade of the lonely wood,
the residence of Mr. Owen, a surgeon; who, from our not having
for a long range of country encountered a civilized residence,
barring the woodman&rsquo;s cottage, I felt half inclined to
think was only attendant on the quadrupeds of the mountain.&nbsp;
The rocks now assumed a wild and threatening aspect upon our
left, as we emerged into a more open track, and entered <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>upon the
domain of Dolwreiddiog, where Mr. Mawhans has a snug shooting
box, a little beyond which, commences perhaps the wildest scenery
in North Wales.&nbsp; Descending by a rocky path, we came to</p>
<h3>LLYN Y CWM BYCHAM,</h3>
<p>or, the lake of the little hollow, on the opposite margin of
which, the wild and dismal Carrey-y-Saeth, the rock of the arrow,
rears its black head in fearful grandeur.&nbsp; Cwm Bychan, is a
grassy dell, surrounded on all sides by the most frightful
sterility; which while we gazed with wonder on the sublimity of
the scene, made us shudder at the utter desolation it
presented.&nbsp; A poor cottage stands on the farther end of the
valley, from which, having obtained a plentiful supply of milk,
we dismounted, and, fastening our steeds to the gates, we seated
ourselves under the shade of two trees, upon the inviting grass,
which, like the smiles of the world, proved but too treacherous;
many a scream and laugh announcing that the boggy soil had paid
no respect to the garments of either sex.&nbsp; Stones were
therefore procured, and, having ranged them in a magic circle,
the whole party seated themselves to partake of the good cheer,
which <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>a
sturdy Welshman had borne upon his shoulders, and who now
advanced into the middle of the ring.&nbsp; Knives and forks
began to play with astonishing celerity.&nbsp; Fowls, ham,
tongue, &amp;c. &amp;c., vanished as if by enchantment; and mirth
and good humour added zest to the repast.</p>
<p>In this hollow there dwelt a witch called Janet, and a story
is told, which, as its wildness is well adapted to the scenery, I
will endeavour to relate.&nbsp; The circumstances are said to
have been confessed by old Janet, when under the last
torture.</p>
<h3>THE WITCH OF CWM BYCHAN.</h3>
<p>In the year 1647, when the Parliamentary forces were besieging
the castle of Harlech, there happened to be a sturdy trooper,
named Jacob Strong-ith-arm, amongst them, a raw-boned man, of
about forty years of age, who had a most sanctimonious visage,
and a strong nasal twang, which the hypocrites he commanded
generally affected as the acceptable tone in which the Lord
delighted.&nbsp; He had in his youth been a butcher&rsquo;s boy;
but sanctity and the cutting the throats of the royalists had
elevated him to the rank of captain in Oliver&rsquo;s army.&nbsp;
This man being stationed under General Mytton, during the siege
of Harlech Castle, fancied <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>himself in love with Mary Carrol,
the daughter of a farmer in the neighbourhood, who was shrewdly
suspected of being a favourer of the besieged party.&nbsp; This,
however, Jacob did not choose to notice; and, whenever an assault
upon the castle was repulsed by the royalists, he returned to lay
siege to the heart of Mary Carrol, who had an utter abhorrence to
all fanatics and sanctified faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, Mrs. Mary Carrol,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;I
love thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by the honour of a cavalier,&rdquo; replied the
maiden, &ldquo;I love thee not, Jacob;&rdquo; for she concealed
not her attachment to the royal party, although her father
constantly cautioned her to do so.</p>
<p>Long and vainly did Jacob endeavour to obtain the young
girl&rsquo;s affections.&nbsp; At length, he bethought himself of
Janet, the witch of Cwm Bychan, whose fame was spread for many a
mile the country round; and one evening in March a man muffled in
a horseman&rsquo;s cloak was seen stumbling over the broken rocks
and patches of broom and furze that impeded his way to the
cottage where she lived.&nbsp; The moon was obscured by the
density of the atmosphere, and small dark remnants of clouds
swept midway through the valley, portending heavy rain and <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>tempest.&nbsp; Often did he kneel and lift his
trembling hands, as if in prayer, as he approached the cottage,
and many times did he turn round affrighted, believing he heard a
brownie brush behind him.&nbsp; At length, he saw a small white
dog running towards him, wagging its tail, and looking very glad
to see him.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all these tokens of welcome,
the teeth of Jacob chattered in his head, as he followed his
canine conductor, and his heart sank within him.</p>
<p>When he came to the door, it seemed to fly open without the
aid of hands, and, in the middle of the hut, over a turf fire,
sat Janet the witch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said she, and
repeated these doggerel lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou lovest a young and a pretty bird,<br
/>
And little she cares for thee;<br />
But Mary shall carol, and love thee well,<br />
If thou&rsquo;lt give gold to me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;By the devil and all his imps, Janet,&rdquo; said
Jacob, mustering up all the courage he could to support his
profanity, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give thee a hundred good pounds if
thou wilt make her love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain!&rdquo; quoth Janet, and she
griped his hand till he thought he felt all the <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>blood in
his body running out at his fingers ends, and then she gave him
this warning:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the change is wrought, shouldst thou
in aught<br />
&rsquo;Gainst thy free oath rebel,<br />
Soon shall, in dole, Harlech&rsquo;s bell toll<br />
A sinner&rsquo;s parting knell!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Go thou to Mary&rsquo;s cottage to-morrow morning by
the ninth hour; thou shalt find her mind altered, and on the
third morning will I call on thee for the fulfilment of thy
promise.&nbsp; Away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, he found himself suddenly whisked away into the
centre of a furze bush, where, stuck fast, he stood gaping at the
door of the cottage, which closed against him, as if by
enchantment, and all was as quiet as before he had entered it,
save the whistling wind and the driving rain, which the clouds
now discharged in torrents.</p>
<p>A festival was to be held that night on the side of Mount
Atlas, and all witches were desired to attend and join in the
revelry, at the command of his imperious majesty, Satan himself;
and, no sooner had Jacob departed, than old Janet began to anoint
herself, singing her incantations all the while.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;To thee, to thee, thou mighty one!<br />
Whose name is big with fear,<br />
I pay my adoration deep,<br />
While I anoint me here;</p>
<p>And in this ointment I have put<br />
Mixtures of mighty power,<br />
To aid my flight, through the night,<br />
To thee, at trysting hour.</p>
<p>The Lady Gordon&rsquo;s fav&rsquo;rite child<br />
I&rsquo;ve roasted for this night,<br />
And thus its fat upon my lids<br />
I drop to aid my sight.</p>
<p>Come dance around, my fav&rsquo;rite imps,<br />
Robin and Prick-ear come!<br />
Twice must the ocean wide be crossed<br />
Ere we again come home.</p>
<p>With serpents&rsquo; oil I smear my cheeks,<br />
To smooth my wrinkled skin,<br />
And outward wear the show of youth,<br />
Though all is old within.</p>
<p>With blood of matricide I dye<br />
My lips to ruby red,<br />
And with the deep black soot of hell<br />
The white locks of my head;</p>
<p>With tints from murdered virgin&rsquo;s face<br />
I gaily deck my own,<br />
Till either cheek appears to wear<br />
A rose flower newly blown;</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>Come
dance around, my favourite imps,<br />
Robin and Prick-ear come,<br />
Twice must the ocean wide be crossed,<br />
Ere we again come home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her preparations being completed, she mounted upon the back of
Robin, and attended by Prick-ear, flew through the air to the
witches&rsquo; festival.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Mauritania, who resided in the vicinity of
Mount Atlas, were struck with fear and wonder at the flickering
lights and fitful sounds of numerous instruments that were seen
and heard upon the mountain&rsquo;s sides.&nbsp; Loud peals of
laughter and shouts of merriment astonished the peasantry, for
many miles around!&nbsp; Glad enough was the arch-fiend to see
old Janet, who was a favourite, and he knew she had done his
service ably.&nbsp; She knelt down, and did him homage, repeated
the accursed prayer, and recounted to him the deeds she had
performed since the last merry meeting,&mdash;at which he smiled,
and gave her a smack that sounded like the report of a piece of
ordnance; and back to back, with arms locked together, did they
whisk it about, to the great delight of the assembly; after
which, Prick-ear, who had assumed his human shape, led her to the
feast, and whispered <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>soft words into his mistress&rsquo;s
ear; and they kissed and toyed, as did the rest; and in mirth,
love, and jollity, the night passed rapidly away.&nbsp; But Janet
forgot not in her mirth, to beg a boon of Satan, which was, that
he would turn the inclinations of Mary Carrol upon the trooper,
Jacob Strong-ith-arm, which being granted, the usual ceremony at
parting was performed, and again crossing the ocean, she arrived
at Cwm Bychan before the dawn, with her attendant imps.</p>
<p>With a fluttering heart, Jacob knocked at the door of his
mistress, on the morning after his adventure with old Janet, and
could scarcely believe his good fortune, when he saw Mary, with
smiles of delight, hasten to the door, to welcome him; and he
inwardly blessed the old witch for having performed her promise
so faithfully.&nbsp; He spoke of love to Mary, and she heard him
without a frown; and so impatient was the accepted lover, that
the third day was appointed for the marriage to take place.&nbsp;
But Jacob thought no more of the witch who had brought about his
good fortune.</p>
<p>The third morning came, and the bells were ringing merrily the
wedding peal for Mary Carrol and Jacob Strongith-arm, and all
their friends were seated at breakfast in the bride&rsquo;s
cottage, <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>when, as the clock struck nine, three distinct and
heavy knocks were heard at the door, which being opened, old
Janet presented herself before the astonished party, for they all
believed she had evil communication with Satan.</p>
<p>The bridegroom grew red with shame and passion, and when Janet
told him she had come for the payment he promised, he vowed, if
she did not quit the house, he would tie her neck and heels, and
fling her out of the window.&nbsp; This threat made Janet
wrathful, and with heavy maledictions that struck terror into the
hearts of all the company, she turned her back upon them, and
departed from the house.</p>
<p>No sooner had she quitted it, than a new wonder
arose&mdash;the bride flew hastily to her apartment, nor could
all her friends prevail upon her to quit it.&nbsp; Her former
dislike to Jacob returned with redoubled violence.&nbsp; She
refused to become his bride, and kneeling down returned thanks to
heaven for the fate she had escaped.&nbsp; All was
confusion.&nbsp; The disappointed bridegroom with dreadful
threats of vengeance, dashed furiously out of the house, in the
direction of Cwm Bychan.</p>
<p>Rage subdued fear in his breast, and the pathless rocks, over
which he had to scramble, seemed to add fresh fuel to his
flames.&nbsp; Long <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>and loudly did he knock at the door of Janet&rsquo;s
hut, until maddened with delay, he with his foot sent it flying
from its hinges, and there he saw a figure resembling himself
modelled in wax, with a needle passed through the body, placed
before a fire&mdash;and on a sudden Jacob began to sweat with
fear.&nbsp; All the horrors attached to this well known ceremony
amongst witches, rushed to memory.&nbsp; He remembered the story
of King Duncan of Scotland, which he had often read over, with
pious terror, in the pages of Hollingshed, who was in this way
tortured by a witch, and, with prayers and ejaculations, he ran
from his effigy, stumbling and breaking his knees over the rugged
stones, while thorns and briars tore his quivering flesh, as,
unconscious of the pain, he scrambled through.&nbsp; At length,
in horrid plight, breathless and faint, he reached his quarters
in the town of Harlech, where he was shortly after put to bed in
extreme agony, both of body and mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Weary seven nights, nine times nine,<br />
Did he dwindle, peak, and pine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, General Mytton was hotly besieging the castle,
which was defended, with almost unprecedented bravery, by William
<a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>Owain,
the governor, with no more than twenty-eight followers.&nbsp; In
vain did the clang of arms strike upon the warlike ears of
Jacob;&mdash;he might have exclaimed, in the language of
Othello&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Farewell the plumed troop, and the big
war<br />
Which makes ambition virtue&mdash;oh farewell!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, as he never read such profane authors, he contented
himself with a pious curse or two every second on the witch who
had reduced him to such a state of feebleness.&nbsp; He who was
once foremost in the onset, whose voice would animate his
soldiers with a religious zeal, and oft reclaim the fortune of
the fight&mdash;the brawny, fearless Presbyterian lay like a
puling infant on his bed, wasted and pale, with scarcely breath
enough to render himself audible to those around him.</p>
<p>Sorely did Mytton need his aid, his reckless daring in leading
an assault&mdash;for the stimulating energy of his example was
electric.</p>
<p>One night, when he heard the loud shouts of the enemy, and the
declining voices of his friends, Jacob grasped his sword, and,
starting from his bed, rushed, or rather staggered, to the
barbican, which had been scaled by a small body of the <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>parliament
forces, who surprised the warders at the drawbridge, which
crossed the fosse upon the inside, when, from the interior a body
of the royalists rushed with desperate valour, the assailing
party were forced to retreat by opening the massy gate of the
barbican, but not without leaving many wounded and dying comrades
in the deep fosse, into which they had been thrown during the
struggle on the drawbridge.&nbsp; At this critical moment, when
disgrace appeared to hang over the banner of his leader, Jacob,
<i>en chemise</i>, forced his way into the scene of action,
striking terror to the foe, who took him for an apparition, and
invigorating the hearts of his friends.&nbsp; The royalists, who
had advanced, were driven back again in their turn.</p>
<p>But the hope of victory betrayed the besiegers to their
ruin.&nbsp; Jacob, determined to take the castle or die, with a
huge axe was cutting through the drawbridge to deprive his
followers of all hope of escape, by retreating that way; and the
battle became furious beneath the double portcullis which crowns
the principal entrance.&nbsp; The besieged were driven nearly
into the inner court, when the mighty voice of Owain cried
aloud&mdash;&ldquo;Let fall the portcullis!&rdquo;&nbsp; So
promptly was this order obeyed, that the outer and inner grating
enclosed the besiegers, as in a <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>cage, and left them entirely at the
mercy of their conquerors.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Jacob, his weakness prevented him from
carrying his purpose into effect, and he retired, covered with
confusion, to his bed, while his companions whom he was forced to
leave behind, resigned their arms, through the inner grating, to
their enemies, and were then committed to the dungeons of the
fortress.</p>
<p>On the morning after this defeat, a party of men, who had been
sent into the mountains to forage for goats, sheep, or provender
of any kind that might fall in their way, chanced to pass near
old Janet&rsquo;s dwelling, and they resolved to revenge the
cruel persecution of their captain, if they could light upon the
witch, who had occasioned his long sufferings.&nbsp; Accordingly,
they entered the cottage, where they perceived, before the dying
embers of a turf fire, the waxen image with which she worked the
charm, almost wasted away, but still bearing a strong resemblance
to Jacob Strongith-arm.&nbsp; This they seized, and instantly
committed to the water, placing, at the same time, some dried
wood upon the turf, which, with the aid of some gunpowder, was
ignited.&nbsp; A quantity of dried furze and heather was then
piled upon it, and, in a <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>short time, the flames communicated
with the rafters of every part of the building.</p>
<p>As they turned from the cottage, one of the party perceived an
old woman floating upon a plank on the lake, twisting and
jumping, capering and splashing, in a manner that made his hair
stand on end.&nbsp; It was old Janet herself, whose imps had
deserted her, or he would never have been able to detect her at
her pastime.&nbsp; There she floated, twirling about, sometimes
on one leg, and then upon the other, till all of them being
convinced it was the witch, they resolved to seize her, and
convey her to the General.</p>
<p>Three of them, named John Brown, James Haddock, and Joseph
Stilt, being the most courageous of the party, volunteered to
capture her, though the devil himself stood at her elbow, while
she, not knowing that her imp, Robin, whose power made her
invisible to mortal eyes, had quitted her, kept dancing on,
without dreaming of any harm that could befall her from the
approach of mortals, although the plank upon which she stood
nearly touched the border of the pool.&nbsp; Suddenly, Joseph
Stilt, who was the foremost, roared out&mdash;&ldquo;The witch!
the witch!&mdash;we have her!&rdquo;&nbsp; Janet then, for the
first time, felt afraid; but she still had some <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>power left,
and Joseph Stilt, as he made a spring to come up with her, stuck
fast in a quagmire as deep as his chin, close to the edge of the
lake, where he remained storming, without the power to extricate
himself.&nbsp; James Haddock, who leaped over his head, sank to
the bottom, and narrowly escaped drowning.&nbsp; But John Brown,
who always carried a verse of scripture in front of his hat,
calling on the Virgin for support, alighted on the plank by the
witch&rsquo;s side, and, seizing her by the hair, ferried her to
a safe landing place, when his comrades, James Haddock, and
Joseph Stilt, having been assisted, by their fellows, out of
jeopardy, assisted him to convey her to Harlech, where they were
told that the dreadful exudations of Jacob had ceased, and, upon
comparing their accounts, they found that his recovery commenced
at the very moment when they flung his waxen effigy into the
water, and set fire to the witch&rsquo;s hut.</p>
<p>When Janet was brought before the General and Jacob
Strongith-arm, she laughed to see his once stout frame dwindled
as it was, and her laugh frightened them all; so they tied her to
a stake, and then began to question her; but she disdained to
make any reply.&nbsp; They then tried the torture of the
thumb-screw, but Janet only <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>spat in their faces, for the devil
was strong within her; and James Haddock lost his eye, from the
heat of her saliva.&nbsp; The soldiers marvelled at her
obstinacy, and Jacob, growing full of ire, commanded them to fire
a harquebuss at her, if she persisted in her stubbornness.&nbsp;
But this threat only increased the fiendish laugh of old Janet
into a yell of scorn.&nbsp; All threats proving useless, the
harquebussier fired his piece.&nbsp; But how were they astonished
to see the witch grinning defiance at them all, and holding the
ball up between her right finger and thumb!&nbsp; Another was
fired at her, which she caught in the left!&nbsp; Stilt, mad to
see her triumph thus, ran at her with his sword, which shivered
to pieces upon her breast; and all this time the witch laughed,
and spat at, and reviled them.&nbsp; At length, Brown, who had
first arrested her, remembering he had been told that a witch, if
bled in any of the veins that cross the temples would soon give
up the ghost, walked boldly up to her, when the devil, scared at
his intentions, instantly quitted his votaress, and she, left
helpless, could only storm, and rave, and curse, and beg for
life.&nbsp; But Brown drew the keen blade across the full purple
veins, and, with a scream of terror, she fell to the ground.</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>Many
crimes did she confess to the holy man, who attended her last
moments; besides the one just related, which render &ldquo;the
little hollow,&rdquo; a spot of fearful interest to the
mountaineer, who, as he passes the lake at nightfall, turns many
an anxious glance behind, and fancies that he hears, at times,
the sound of unearthly voices in the gale, that sweeps by him in
this wild and lonely dell.</p>
<p>The castle was soon after surrendered to the Parliament
forces, by its brave commander, who had the honor of knowing,
that he was the last, who yielded up the trust confided to him,
by his sovereign.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Our repast being concluded, we again mounted our horses, and
commenced an ascent up a dank, cheerless hollow, called <i>Bwlch
Tyddiad</i>.&nbsp; Nothing can exceed the wildness of the
scenery, by which we were surrounded.&nbsp; Huge masses of rock,
riven by the thunder bolt, or loosened by the frost, lay
scattered in every direction, while, towering upon either side,
the herbless mountains frowned, barren, black, grey, and
terrible.</p>
<p>Our horses, accustomed, I presume, to such excursions, picked
their way with the greatest care and safety, and my
&ldquo;Gallant Brown,&rdquo; <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>cleared every impediment, as if he
had been foaled amongst the Alps, and loved them better than the
verdant plain.&nbsp; Drawing nearer to the top of the cliff, the
shepherds had made a stair-like path of flat stones, along which
our cavalcade proceeded with caution; when suddenly we halted
upon hearing the distant halloos of travellers ascending the
opposite side of the mountain; and presently three persons, one
of whom was leading a wearied animal by the bridle, became
distinctly visible.&nbsp; A shout of recognition from our party
roused all the echoes of the surrounding hills.&nbsp; The
figures, as they became more distinct, seemed magically
transported with myself into the heart of the Sierra Morena,
where Cardenio, Don Quixote, and Sancho Panza, appeared to me in
their proper persons; for never was description better realized,
than in the figures that now presented themselves.&nbsp; The
first was a handsome, well formed man, with light brown hair,
which hung in plentiful thickness upon his shoulders; his
untrimmed beard, joined by overhanging moustachios, and the two
being united to the upper growth, by a pair of whiskers, the
luxuriance of which shewed they were permitted to grow in
uninterrupted freedom.&nbsp; His throat was bare, and his dress
negligent.&nbsp; The second figure that attracted my <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>attention,
was a very tall and extremely thin young man, with a serious cast
of features, that would have done honor to the knight of the
woful countenance.&nbsp; In his hand he led a jaded hack, which
in the ascent seemed to have yielded up three parts of its
existence.&nbsp; Here then was the Rosinante of Cervantes in a
breathing form; while, by his side, a short good humoured little
man, with a huge portmanteau buckled on his back, walked like a
faithful squire, and made an admirable substitute for the
immortal Sancho; and, as he turned his eyes from precipice to
glen, it required no great stretch of imagination, to think they
were wandering in search of his beloved Dapple.&nbsp; We met upon
a patch of green moss; and here our hamper was again unpacked, to
cheer the hearts of these toil worn travellers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

"View from Carreg y Saeth"
 src="images/p209s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>By their advice, we ascended to the summit of the mountain,
the view from which was grand and extensive.&nbsp; To the
eastward, a vast country lies beneath, bounded by Cader Idris,
the two Arrenigs, and a long range of mountains.&nbsp;
Immediately under the lofty eminence, upon which we rested, was a
small round lake, and the pass Ardudwy, which exceeds even the
celebrated Llanberris in rugged grandeur.&nbsp; The way by which
our new companions ascended was both <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>laborious and dangerous; but they
would not have sacrificed the prospect now presented to them on
any account.&nbsp; North and south the eye glances over the
summits of wild mountains, and to the west the Carnaervonshire
chain, cut in two, as it were, by a high mountain, immediately
before us, forms the shore of a noble sheet of water, resembling
a spacious lake, where the sea stretches its arm, into the vale
of Maentwrog, out of Cardigan Bay.&nbsp; The declining sun gave
us warning that it was time to quit these wilds, and make the
best of our way to the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>The return is extremely hazardous on horseback.&nbsp; The
ladies of the party, therefore, resigning their steeds to the
conduct of some mountaineers, and the gentlemen leading their
horses by the bridle, commenced the descent.&nbsp; But as I could
not, from lameness, advantage myself by like caution, and feeling
confident in the tact, strength, and docility of my favourite, I
led the way, without experiencing the slightest symptom of
uneasiness.</p>
<p>When we had proceeded about half way down, a circumstance
occurred, that occasioned some unpleasantness.&nbsp; A horse had
broken loose from one of the leaders, and at full speed came
galloping down the steep and rugged descent.&nbsp; <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>The animal
conducted by the tall, thin gentlemen, before described, started
as his fellow quadruped rushed by him, and, freeing himself from
control, dashed after him, at an alarming pace; leaving his late
master, with eyes starting out of their sockets, and mouth wide
open, with affright, his arms spread out, and his whole frame in
convulsions of terror, upon the top of a large stone, ludicrously
bewildered.&nbsp; My steed, evincing the truth of the proverb,
&ldquo;evil communications&rdquo; etc. for a moment lost his
presence of mind, and despising my efforts to restrain him,
bounded over sundry perilous rocky fragments, in desperate
pursuit.&nbsp; However, by divers forcible arguments, I at length
succeeded in convincing him of his error, and he returned to his
duty.</p>
<p>The two runaways were soon out of sight, and as we concluded
they had broken their necks, we moved rather solemnly to the
bottom of the hollow, where our fears were dissipated, by finding
them quietly browsing in the green meadows, where we had before
seated ourselves at pic-nic.&nbsp; All here remounted; the
sun&rsquo;s rays still lingering upon the heights of
<i>Carreg-y-Saeth</i>, but the pool below looked black and
cheerless.&nbsp; As we proceeded, the beautiful calm light of
evening, the cool and refreshing air, <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>&ldquo;the shard borne beetle, with
his drowsy hum,&rdquo; the forest flies and midges dancing in the
clear ether, the murmuring of mountain streams, and the joyous
notes of our little party, uniting with the sharp tones of our
horses&rsquo; shoes, clinking against the rocky fragments, formed
a combination of pleasing sounds and images in this romantic
solitude, which I shall ever remember with feelings of interest
and delight.&nbsp; After riding about three miles, surrounded by
every charm that could make the time pass pleasantly, we arrived
at the place of parting.&nbsp; A road branching to the right led
directly to Harlech, a distance of about two miles; and here,
with a feeling of regret, I hardly ever before experienced, I
took leave of my kind conductor, and his agreeable friends, a man
being appointed to walk with me as far as Harlech, for the
purpose of taking back his master&rsquo;s horse.</p>
<p>Slowly and sadly I pursued my solitary ride, nor did I once
address my attendant, until I arrived at the inn, where
dismounting, I committed to his charge my gallant supporter
throughout the day.</p>

<h3>HARLECH.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Blue Lion Inn, built by Sir R.
W. Vaughan, <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>for the accommodation of travellers and tourists, is
most delightfully situated.&nbsp; A carriage road from the north
leads round to the front, which faces the sea; and forming a
semicircle, permits the vehicles to drive, through a gate on the
south end of the house, again into the high road.&nbsp; Great
taste is displayed in the erection of this pleasant building; the
parapet wall, with its circular turrets, in which seats are
placed for the accommodation of visitors, and the terrace with
its neat shrubberies.&nbsp; I must also acknowledge, that the
kind attention of the landlord and his servants, deserves the
highest commendation.</p>
<p>The view from the terrace is indescribably beautiful.&nbsp;
The sea lies stretched beneath; the majestic ruins of Harlech
Castle stand upon a rocky base, frowning in solitary grandeur
upon the right; and beyond, the long line of Carnaervonshire
hills projects, like Cambria&rsquo;s lance, forbidding the waves
to make further inroads upon her territories.</p>
<p>Pwlhelli and Port Maddock are distinctly visible from this
spot; and the lovers of fine prospects may remain at the Blue
lion for a week, without wishing to stray further than the
terrace in search of the sublime and beautiful.&nbsp; The
continual variety of light and shadow, with <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>which the
mountains are alternately robed, the freshness of the air, and
the solemn majesty of the ruined fortress, form altogether a
volume for the mind to peruse with intense and unwearied
interest.</p>
<h3>HARLECH CASTLE.</h3>
<p>The present castle was built by Edward I. in 1283, upon the
ruins of one erected by <i>Maelgwn Gwynedd</i>, Prince of North
Wales, in 530.&nbsp; It was seized by the Welsh hero, Owen
Glyndwr, during his struggle for freedom against Henry IV, and
was retaken about four years afterwards, by an army sent by that
monarch into Wales.&nbsp; After the defeat of Henry VI. at
Northampton, this castle afforded a retreat for his queen, but
being hotly pursued by the Lord Stanley, she was compelled to fly
from hence with great precipitation, leaving her jewels and other
valuables behind her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>In 1468, this place was in possession of
Dafydd-ap-Ivan-ap-Einion, a man of singular strength and beauty,
and of unconquerable bravery.&nbsp; Being a firm friend to the
Lancastrian line, the Earl William of Pembroke was despatched to
reduce the fortress; and, after encountering incredible
difficulties, marching <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>through the very heart of the
British Alps, he at length invested the castle, and committed the
management of the siege to his brother Sir Richard Herbert, a man
equal in size and prowess to the British commandant.&nbsp; The
reply of the Welshman, when called upon to surrender, deserves to
be handed down as a specimen of bravery and loyalty.&nbsp; He had
never acknowledged the sovereignty of Edward; and for nine years,
had defied his threats.&nbsp; His answer was in keeping with the
line of conduct he had adopted: &ldquo;Tell your leader,&rdquo;
said he to the messenger, &ldquo;that some years ago I held a
castle in France against its besiegers so long, that all the old
women in Wales talked of me: tell your commander, that I intend
to defend this Welsh castle now, until all the old women in
France shall hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Famine, however, at last subdued him; but he yielded only upon
honourable terms, Sir Richard pledging himself for his
safety.&nbsp; The king at first refused to subscribe to the
conditions; but Sir Richard, with a spirit that cannot be
sufficiently applauded, instantly informed his majesty that he
must take his own life first; for if he lived he would certainly
replace the Welsh chieftain in his strong hold again.&nbsp; The
king was too well acquainted with the value of Sir <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>Richard&rsquo;s services and scrupulous honour, to
persist in his unjust intentions.&nbsp; He therefore, ratified
the conditions, and pardoned the chief.&nbsp; But the brave
Englishman was soon after recalled from his military command.</p>
<p>In the civil wars of Charles I. Harlech Castle was the last
that held out for the king, under the command of William Owain,
who surrendered on the ninth of March, 1647.</p>
<p>Upon the side which faces the sea, the castle must have been
impregnable; the walls are scarcely distinguishable from the
rocky base, the whole being a continued surface of dark grey
masonry; and the north and south sides appear nearly as
inaccessible.&nbsp; The gateway upon the eastward side is
situated between two immense rounders, resembling those of Conway
and Carnaervon.&nbsp; The form of the castle is a square, each
side measuring seventy yards, and at each corner is a round
tower; but the turrets that were once attached to them the
unsparing hand of Time has destroyed.&nbsp; Before the entrance
is a deep fosse, cut in the solid rock; across which a drawbridge
was constructed for security and convenience.</p>
<p>The principal apartments are on the eastward, or entrance,
side of the inner court.&nbsp; The banqueting hall is opposite;
the windows <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>of which look out upon the green surface of the sea;
and, on the right of the court, there formerly stood a small
chapel; the ruins of which are still visible, the pointed window
remaining entire.&nbsp; It is impossible to conceive a finer view
than is obtained from the towers of Harlech Castle.&nbsp; With a
clear atmosphere, the monarch of the Welsh mountains may be
distinctly seen, towering above his subject hills.&nbsp; The
promontories of Lleyn and Cricaeth Castle, are likewise objects
of considerable interest; the latter forming a head to a long
neck of land that juts into the sea from the Carnaervonshire
coast, backed by a chain of noble mountains.&nbsp; This castle
likewise owes its foundation to Edward I.</p>
<p>Harlech is one of those places the traveller leaves with
regret, and a feeling that he can never see any so beautiful
again; and from this place to the village of Maentwrog, the road
increases in beauty every mile.</p>
<p>The Bay of Cardigan, expanding to the ocean, lies beneath, on
the left; upon the right, wild rocks and woody hills alternately
diversify the prospect, and, approaching the northern extremity
of the bay, the Traith Mawr and Traith Bach, two arms of the sea
(the former running up to Port Madoc, and the latter into the
vale of Maentwrog), are noble objects.</p>
<p><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>The
Traith Bach, bounded by mountains upon either side, prepares the
tourist for the heavenly quietude which reigns eternally in the
bosom of this earthly paradise; and, about two miles from the
village, near a farm house called Cemlyn, one of the most
beautiful views of the valley lies stretched before him.&nbsp; A
woody dingle opens on the right, down which the Velin Rhyd rushes
impetuously, mingling its bright waters with the smoothly
meandering Dwyryd, which commingling, flow gracefully into
Cardigan Bay.</p>
<p>In front, and upon the right of the vale, lies the little
picturesque village of Maentwrog, reposing at the foot of a lofty
mountain.&nbsp; Fine green meadow lands enrich the centre of the
valley, through which the river, like a silver serpent,
&ldquo;drags its slow length along.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon the
opposite side is seen the mansion of Tan y Bwlch, backed by a
mountain forest, and ornamented by a noble terrace in front, with
pleasure grounds and walks, which the eye loves to rest upon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The road to Festiniog, at the extreme point of the landscape,
winds up the enclosing hills that fill up the back ground.&nbsp;
To be appreciated, the view must be seen: the most glowing
description would fall incalculably short of the reality.</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>At
this spot I was accosted by a very inquisitive personage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine evening, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walking far to-day, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great many gentlemen come from London to see this
valley, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; (trying to shake him off, but it
would not do).</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come from London, I think, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because a great many London people come this way,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do not many other travellers come this road, who
are not Londoners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, sir, but I took you for a Londoner by the cut
of your coat.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve come a long way to-day,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, but how should you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the condition of your boots, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a hit I did not anticipate; for, truth to say I was
nearly bootless, at least the <i>soles</i> had nearly left their
<i>bodies</i>, upper leathers I mean, and stood mortally in need
of regeneration; and, as I had not provided myself with a second
pair, thinking they would prove cumbersome in my knapsack, his
remark was felt from toe to heel.</p>
<p><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want these repaired, I dare say,
sir, while you remain at the Oakley Arms&mdash;comfortable
inn&mdash;capital beds, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I think I shall, my friend; perhaps you can
recommend me to a cobbler, in the village yonder,&rdquo;
(pointing to Maen Twrog).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a boot maker, sir, in the village, and have
cobbled, as you are pleased to call it, the soles of all
strangers in need, for the last twenty years.&nbsp; My father
performed that office before me; and I may say, my all (awl) of
life depends upon the gentlemen who visit our beautiful
valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not employed then by the inhabitants of your
native village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>was</i>, sir; but a new comer, who wrote over his
door &lsquo;leather cutter,&rsquo; cut me out; for I never found
business enough to set up a shop, and so, sir, I am obliged to
watch for customers, to keep up my trade.&nbsp; Those boots of
yours, sir, will give me dinners for half the week, if you will
only let me give them welts, soles, and heel-taps.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got a fine foot, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This piece of gross flattery did not prevent my telling him to
follow me to the inn, and receive the reward of his perseverance
and industry.</p>
<h3><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>THE
OAKLEY ARMS.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TAN Y BWLCH.</span></h3>
<p>I was tired, and gladly resigned my dilapidated boots to the
care of my <i>soles&rsquo;</i> physician; who, with a most
respectful bow, promised to let me have them by eight
o&rsquo;clock on the following morning.</p>
<p>Having partaken of a most excellent dish of fish, a small
portion of roasted mutton, strawberry tartlet, cheese, celery,
&amp;c., I thought I should like to try my fortune in the lovely
stream of Dwyryd.&nbsp; I therefore requested the waiter to
procure me the loan of a pair of shoes or boots, suitable for the
purpose, proposing to pay for the accommodation.&nbsp; I was soon
supplied, and, anticipating a delightful evening&rsquo;s sport,
sallied forth with complete apparatus.</p>
<p>How deceitful are the views of man!&nbsp; I cast my
line&mdash;it was a fatal cast&mdash;I struck at an imaginary or
real rise, and in an instant all my hopes were crushed; for my
rod broke off at the second joint, and sailing down the stream,
was suddenly brought up by one of the flies hooking a fragment of
rock.&nbsp; With much trouble I recovered the shattered top
pieces, but in <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>endeavouring to extricate my fly, my foot slipped, and
I found myself up to my waist in water, and my foot jammed
between two pieces of rock at the bottom, from whence I was glad
to extricate it by leaving my shoe behind.&nbsp; It was very
unfortunate.&nbsp; I cursed my ill-luck, sat down upon the bank,
put up my flies, put my broken rod in its case, and prepared to
return to my inn.&nbsp; But&mdash;I had only one shoe!&nbsp; I
endeavoured to recover the lost one, but in vain.&nbsp; Doubtless
it was buffetting its way amongst rushing waters and fragments of
rock, full half a mile off by this time.&nbsp; How I should get
to the Oakley Arms, through all the uneven stony ways, I knew
not.&nbsp; I could not hop all the way, it was very evident; and
to attempt to walk with but one shoe, would deprive me of the
sole of my foot.&nbsp; At this moment, taking out my silk
handkerchief to wipe my brows&mdash;ah!&mdash;the thing was
settled.&nbsp; I bound it as many times doubled as I could round
my foot, tying it about with a part of my fishing line, and in
this lamentable state, I reached the house.</p>
<p>No routed warrior from the field of battle ever looked more
chop-fallen than I, in re-entering my late happy
dining-room.&nbsp; It was not an hour&mdash;no, not an hour
ago&mdash;when, all elate and joyous, I walked forth, pregnant
with hope and jollity.&nbsp; Look <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>at me now&mdash;&rsquo;twas
lamentable!&nbsp; I rang the bell; the waiter came in, and no
sooner cast his eyes on me, than he broke into an uncontrollable
laugh.&nbsp; I confess I expected a very different reception, and
my first impulse was to kick him out of the room; but casting my
eyes upon my handkerchief-bound foot, turned the whole current of
my feelings, and I could not forbear joining in the laugh, for
the soul of me.</p>
<p>The waiter&rsquo;s view of the case was undoubtedly the
correct one.&nbsp; I felt it, and it was actually with difficulty
I accounted to him for my present appearance, my ideas had
undergone so complete a revolution from tragic to comic!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rsquo;tis a funny world,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;bring me a pair of slippers, water to wash, a bottle of
port, and a cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was just in the marrow of my cigar, when two young
gentlemen, who had pedestrianized from Llanrwst since the
morning, entered the room.&nbsp; They were fair-haired Saxons,
and particularly unacquainted with all they had seen in their
route.&nbsp; I requested them to join me, and they were pleased
to honour me with their company.&nbsp; But their stock of
information being remarkably small, I resolved within myself to
avoid the route they intended to pursue on the following morning,
and understanding they <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>meant to visit Harlech Castle, I
informed them I should pursue my way to Tremadoc.&nbsp; As I
could not extract any information from these tourists, I called
for pen, ink and paper, and amused myself with putting down the
events of the day, while one of the young men flung his legs upon
the sofa, and the other placed his feet on the fender.&nbsp; Deep
sonorous notes soon succeeded this arrangement, and I pursued my
task without any other interruption, until my attention was drawn
to the heavy pattering of rain against the window, and the
whistling of a keen wind through the passage.&nbsp; I felt
chilly, and drew nearer the fire.&nbsp; The task I imposed upon
myself being finished, and the servant having brought me my bed
candlestick, I retired to rest, leaving my agreeable companions
in the midst of a nasal duet.</p>
<p>Oh, the comforts of a clean room, clean sheets, and a good
bed!&nbsp; These I experienced at the Oakley Arms; and I arose
refreshed, and eager to commence my walk; but I was doomed to
disappointment, for on drawing up the blind of my window, a dark
and dismal morning presented itself, the rain falling in
torrents, and the lovely valley transformed into a gloomy gorge
of rolling clouds.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to be done? thought I; jump
into bed again, answered my careful spirit.&nbsp; I <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>obeyed the
suggestion, and slept another hour, when I again awoke, and on
inspection found the day still melancholy and tearful.</p>
<p>I descended to the breakfast room, and there I found my
quondam companions in precisely the same attitudes I had left
them on the preceding night;&mdash;as motionless and silent, but
their musical instruments were out of order, I suppose, as they
no longer sent forth their former deep tones, and their eyes
indeed were differently directed; the gentleman on the sofa
inspecting the ceiling; the other profoundly scrutinizing a Dutch
figure on the chimney-piece, with a foaming pot of porter in one
hand, and a short pipe in the other.&nbsp; It was neither Souter
Johnny, nor Toby Philpot; but I involuntarily roared out
&ldquo;dear Tom, this brown jug,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; It was like
an electric shock to the tourists.&nbsp; One leaped from the
sofa, and the other withdrew his feet from the fender with
precipitation; first stared at each other, and then both at me,
in mute astonishment.&nbsp; I cheerfully bade them good-morrow,
and we sat down to breakfast.</p>
<p>Never did I pray more heartily for a shelter from the storm,
than I did now for a gleam of sunshine to cheer me in this horrid
calm.&nbsp; These rival Incubuses fretted me.&mdash;Ha!
who&rsquo;s that curtseying to me as she passes?&mdash;Oh she
opens <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>her basket, intimating she has something to sell; they
are hose, I perceive.&nbsp; The rain increases rather than abates
its violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come hither, my girl,&rdquo; said I, as I beckoned her
to come in.&nbsp; &ldquo;She will assist in beguiling the tedious
morning,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That like a foul and ugly witch<br />
Does limp so tediously away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, having nothing better to do, I put the events of our
interview into rhyme.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TRAVELLER.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where art thou going, pretty lass?<br />
The rain falls thick and fast;<br />
Come in, and dry thy mantle, maid,<br />
And shun the bleak cold blast.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GIRL.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I heed not, sir, the mountain gale,<br />
Nor thickly falling rain;<br />
For my poor mother lies at home<br />
In sickness and in pain;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I must haste to sell my work,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And much I have to spare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I may purchase winter store<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To free her mind from care.<br />
<a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>For she
is old, and quite infirm,<br />
And child hath none but me,<br />
And oh her heart is yearning now<br />
My face again to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TRAVELLER.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold is the heart that would not beat<br />
To see that face of thine,<br />
Where sweet simplicity hath traced<br />
Her lineaments divine.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned away her head to hide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tear upon her cheek;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While piety beamed in her eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And resignation meek.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GIRL.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh do not, do not stay me, sir,<br />
For I must to the fair,<br />
To sell my hose, and purchase food,<br />
And things for winter wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy thy hose; thou shalt not walk<br />
Beneath the drenching rain,<br />
But tarry here until the sun<br />
Shines brightly forth again.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hose were bought, she sought her home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With smiles upon her face;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart was light, her eyes were bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her every motion, grace.<br />
<a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>And
happy was the traveller&rsquo;s heart<br />
When bidding her farewell;<br />
Her glance of gratitude, said all,<br />
And more, than tongue could tell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the time I had committed this little effusion to paper, the
sun shone out gloriously; and it had the astonishing effect of
giving a sort of animation to the mute gentlemen, who absolutely
rose from their drowsy postures and walked to the window.&nbsp;
Thank heaven! I mentally exclaimed; I have a chance now of
getting rid of my &ldquo;musty superfluity;&rdquo; but I was
mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will now be able to start for Harlech,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why a&mdash;&rdquo; drawled one, &ldquo;I am afraid
it&rsquo;s too late, as we wish to get to bed early
to-night.&nbsp; What do you say, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I think so too, Dick; and so we&rsquo;ll be happy
to join you, sir, in your walk, as I think you said you intended
proceeding to Tremadoc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said I should be happy, with a smile, that extracted from
one of them the question, &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you well,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without replying, I proceeded to put up my little all in the
knapsack; having first desired the waiter to bring my bill.</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better put it all together, and we
can divide it,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>I agreed, and it being discharged, after paying for the shoes
which I borrowed for my evening&rsquo;s sport, and for the
repairing, which was excellently performed by my loquacious
cobbler, I started with my two hopeful friends for
Tremadoc.&nbsp; We however, first went to view the grounds of
Tan-y-bwlch, the seat of W. G. Oakley Esq.&nbsp; The name
signifies &ldquo;below the pass:&rdquo; it is situated on the
side of a hill which overlooks the vale.</p>
<p>From the terrace of this mansion you command one of the most
romantic views in Wales.&nbsp; Harlech Castle is visible upon the
right; the Merionethshire mountains tower in the distance, and
the entire valley, from Festiniog to Traeth Bychen, watered by
the river Dwyryd, is interesting beyond description.&nbsp; Lord
Lyttleton tells us, in his observations upon this valley, that an
honest Welsh farmer, who died there at 105 years of age, had by
his first wife thirty children, ten by his second, and four by
his third.&nbsp; His eldest son was eighty-one years older than
his youngest, and 800 persons, descended from his body, attended
his funeral.</p>
<p>I should be doing injustice to the worthy landlord of the
Maentwrog Inn, whose house I used <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>upon my second visit to this
delightful valley, did I not speak in praise of his attention to
the comforts of all travellers.&nbsp; Good beds, civil waiters,
excellent fare, and cheap charges, render this one of the very
best inns in Wales.&nbsp; And hear, ye lingering tourists! you
may have bed and board for the inconsiderable sum of one guinea
per week; which I think a very considerable temptation to remain
at it a month, for there is sufficient in the neighbourhood to
interest the most phlegmatic of Adam&rsquo;s progeny.&nbsp; From
hence may be visited the following interesting places.&nbsp; The
village of Festiniog, three miles, where there are two good inns,
the Pengwern Arms, and the Newborough Arms, where post horses and
cars are always in readiness; there is also a good boarding-house
kept by Miss Owen.&nbsp; The falls of Cynfael, two and a half;
the slate quarries, five and a half; the cataracts of the Rhaiadr
Du and Ravenfall, two miles; Llyn Llyanyrch, three and a half,
where the trout are excellent; Cwmorddin Pool, lies to the
northward, about four and a half miles, to which the tourist may
be conducted by the railroad.&nbsp; There is a house at each end
of the lake where the angler will find accommodation from the
hospitable owners for a trifling remuneration.&nbsp; Lynn Mannot
contains very large trout, and is six miles from Maentwrog, <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>and Llyn
Morwynion is about the same distance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>We proceeded along the lower road by the north side of the
salts, as the inhabitants of the valley call the arm of the sea,
which here has the appearance of a lake begirt with mountains,
craggy cliffs, and shadowing woods.&nbsp; Here we bade adieu to
the delightful valley of Festiniog, and, after walking about four
miles along a pleasant road, a noble sheet of water met our eyes,
which appeared to be hemmed in by inaccessible mountains,
differing in form from those we had left behind, being more
conical, and some shooting upwards like pyramids into the
clouds.</p>
<p>As we proceeded, we discovered it to be the Traeth Mawr, which
as the sea is hidden from us by a breakwater, has the appearance
of a broad lake.</p>
<p>Upon this breakwater, which extends across the bay, is a
railroad which conveys slates from the quarries at Festiniog to
Port Madoc, where it is calculated ten thousand tons are shipped
annually.&nbsp; Port Madoc receives its name from the late
William Alexander Maddoc Esq., of Tan-y-allt, as does the town of
Tremadoc.</p>
<p>The extraordinary efforts of this enterprising man caused him
to be looked up to as the <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>Prince of the soil.&nbsp; He
redeemed, by constructing an embankment of nearly one mile in
length from north to south, across the Traeth Mawr, at the
eastern extremity of Cardigan Bay, a tract of more than 2,700
acres of land.&nbsp; This enterprise was completed in 1811, and
cost upwards of &pound;100,000; so that, with the lands
previously recovered, no less than 7000 acres have been regained,
6000 of which are cultivated.</p>
<p>The view from the breakwater is perhaps the finest in North
Wales for distant mountain scenery.&nbsp; When the tourist has
reached the centre of it, let him turn his back upon the sea, and
upon his right he will perceive a hill, called Plas Newedd, from
which a range of Alpine scenery stretches up to the monarch of
Snowdonia, who towers pre-eminent in the distance.&nbsp; Upon his
left another range, commencing with a hill called Moel Ghaist,
leads up to the same grand object, and the extraordinary variety
displayed in the formation of these wonderful masses with varying
lights and shadows that adorn them with sunny crowns or misty
mantles, produce a sublimity of effect I never before
experienced.&nbsp; A bridge joins the breakwater to the quay at
Port Madoc, under which the tide rushes with great impetuosity,
covering a vast extent of ground at the flood, which is left
nearly <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>dry at the ebb.&nbsp; About half a mile from Port
Madoc, upon a rising ground, stands a handsome house, once the
property, though not the principal residence, of the great
speculator, which is now inhabited by Mr. Williams, a solicitor,
and agent to the creditors of the deceased.&nbsp; Proceeding
along the road, in a short time the tourist obtains a peep at the
little town of Tremadoc; but before reaching it he perceives the
church, an elegant building, with a tower and lofty spire, which
forms a principal object in the landscape.&nbsp; The archway,
under which the church is approached, is a beautiful specimen of
workmanship, and does equal credit to the taste of the founder
and execution of the builder.&nbsp; Divine service is read here
in the English language every Sunday, which is a great
accommodation to the English families residing in the
neighbourhood, as there is no other church within twenty miles
where it is so performed.</p>
<h3>TREMADOC</h3>
<p>or the town of Madoc, is built quadrangularly, and in the
centre of the square is a column with a pedestal, round which are
twelve steps.&nbsp; On the eastern side is a commodious market
house, <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>above which are the assembly rooms.&nbsp; A market is
held here on Fridays, and the Barmouth and Carnaervon coach
passes through three times a-week.</p>
<p>Having refreshed ourselves with a luncheon of salad and cold
meat, we three trudged off together, in spite of wind and
weather, which threatened a speedy commencement of
hostilities.&nbsp; Large masses of vapoury clouds were driven
above our heads; the swallows skimmed the surface of the river,
and brushed the standing corn with their swift wings, as they
flew along in the pursuit of their prey; and the wind blew loud
and shrilly, as in the month of November.&nbsp; At a short
distance from the town, upon the Beddgelert road, is a lofty
hill, the base of which is planted with fir trees; through which
a path winds up to the mansion of Tan-yr-allt, the late beautiful
residence of Mr. Madocks.&nbsp; We had not proceeded far, when we
were compelled to seek shelter in a hollow, of which there are
many at the feet of the enormous precipices which overhang the
road.</p>
<p>The transient storm having passed away, and sunshine once more
lighting up the valley, we again pushed forward.&nbsp; The
Merionethshire mountains upon the right, decked in their
countless hues of rock and heather, over which the departing <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>storm swept
with its rolling clouds, in dark magnificence, formed a noble
subject for the artist&rsquo;s pencil.&nbsp; The road is elevated
above the meadows which enrich the centre of the vale; and the
river, which flows through them, having risen above its banks and
spread itself over a considerable tract of country, resembled an
extensive lake.</p>
<p>About half way between Tremadoc and Beddgelert, is a small
dingle upon the left of the road, with a neat lodge at the
entrance, and a path leading up to the shrubbery, beneath which a
mountain stream flows rapidly, and empties itself into the
Rhine.&nbsp; The path leads up to the residence of Capt.
Parry.&nbsp; As we proceeded, numerous falls dashed down the
mountains and plunging into hollows underneath the road, emerged
again upon the other side.&nbsp; We were several times forced to
take shelter from the heavy showers under fallen blocks of rock;
and once as the storm abated, and we looked anxiously out to see
if it was clear enough to pursue our journey, a glorious rainbow,
stretching across the valley, its points resting upon the
mountains on either side, struck even my snow-models of men with
something like sensibility; for as they crept out of their
sheltering rock, they observed with infantine simplicity,
&ldquo;Well, really that&rsquo;s <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>very pretty.&rdquo;&nbsp; We now
proceeded at a rapid pace, and the river became more deep and
narrow, and the circling eddies, as they floated down the stream,
announced to us that we were approaching the fall of a great body
of water, when suddenly&mdash;whizz, whirr, clash, splash, dash,
astounding and astonishing&mdash;</p>
<h3>ABER GLAS LLYNN,</h3>

</a></p>
<p>with all its world of horrors, burst at once upon our
view.&nbsp; I felt a tremulous sensation within me; a contraction
of the muscles of my throat; an hysterical sob, and a desire to
weep.&nbsp; I stood stone still; while my edifying companions
pursued their way without making a single observation.&nbsp; I
halted upon the centre of the bridge, and gave vent to my
feelings in pencilling down the following</p>
<h3>LINES<br />
<span class="GutSmall">WRITTEN ON THE BRIDGE AT ABER GLAS
LLYNN.</span></h3>
<blockquote><p>Thou of the stormy soul, who left behind<br />
The love of sunny skies and smiling vales,<br />
<a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>With thy
fresh boyhood; thou upon whose brow<br />
Stern care hath written gloom, and worldly wrongs<br />
Made darksome; hither bend thy leaden steps,<br />
And find a home here in this wild abyss!&mdash;<br />
Abode congenial to thy lightless mind.<br />
Ye black huge rocks, drear, mountainous, and stern,<br />
First-born of chaos, everlasting piles<br />
And monuments of the creation&mdash;hail!<br />
Around your heads the thunder rolls in vain,<br />
And the fierce lightnings from your summits bare<br />
Turn harmless.&nbsp; Frown, frown on, ye giants stern,<br />
Majestic emblems of eternity!<br />
The torrents are your tongues, and with their roar<br />
Talk of your dignity for ever.&nbsp; Hail!<br />
White foaming, thundering, falls the boiling flood;<br />
Rocks clash, and echo mocks the horrid din,<br />
While man appalled, stands breathless, in amaze,<br />
And, filled with awe, exalts his thoughts to Him,<br />
Who was, who is, and aye must be supreme!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just above the bridge is a semicircular rock, which forms a
salmon-leap, over which the salmon, at spawning time, first lodge
themselves at the height of five or six yards.&nbsp; Proceeding
through the pass, at every step new wonders met the eye.&nbsp;
The late heavy rains had swollen the mountain waterfalls, and
caused a terrific torrent to roar and struggle through a narrow
channel; for the mountains, forming this southern end of the
vale, approach so near to each other, that <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>they only
afford a contracted flow for the river, and a narrow road, while
their rocky sides rise so perpendicularly, that their summits are
scarcely farther distant from each other than their
foundations.&nbsp; The rushing river was a pure sheet of white;
furious, uncontrollable; nothing but the immense blocks riven
from the mountain&rsquo;s craggy sides could withstand its
dreadful impetuosity.&nbsp; A few stunted fir and larch trees at
the commencement of the pass were seen starting from the dark
clefts upon either side, which threw a deeper shade upon this
awful valley.</p>
<p>Cradock calls this pass &ldquo;the noblest specimen of the
<i>finely horrid</i> the eye can possibly behold.&nbsp; The
poet,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;has not described, nor the
painter pictured so gloomy a retreat.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the last
approach to the mansion of Pluto, through the regions of
Despair.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could have stopped for hours to admire
this splendid example of the sublimity of Nature, but time
pressed, so I pushed on to Beddgelert which is not more than a
mile and a half from the bridge.&nbsp; A solitary mountain ash
which grows about half way up the pass, is the sole bright thing
in this abode of terror, and looks like Beauty in
desolation.&nbsp; Emerging from the pass there is a stone <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>which is
called the chair of Rhys G&ocirc;ch o&rsquo;r&rsquo; Ryri; a
famous mountain bard who lived in the time of Owen Glyndwr.&nbsp;
He resided at the entrance into the Traeth Mawr Sands, from
whence he used to walk, and sitting upon this stone compose his
poems.&nbsp; He died in 1420, at the advanced age of 120 years;
he was a gentleman of property, and was buried in the ancient
priory at</p>
<h3>BEDDGELERT.</h3>
<p>Some are of opinion that this word should be written Celert or
Cilert, Bedd-Cilert, or Cilert&rsquo;s grave; supposing that a
monk or saint of that name was buried here.&nbsp; Another
celebrated bard was entombed at this place, named Daffydd Nanmor,
who died about the year 1460.</p>
<p>The Goat is an excellent inn, and every attention the
traveller can desire is paid with the greatest celerity.&nbsp;
Twenty post horses are kept at this inn for travellers, and eight
or ten ponys for the accommodation of those visitors who wish to
ascend Snowdon with ease and safety. <a name="citation240"></a><a
href="#footnote240" class="citation">[240]</a></p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock, I strolled from the inn to the bridge,
where I was joined by a peasant, who, by his appearance, promised
to be communicative.&nbsp; <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>It was a lovely evening; there was
no moon, but the clear sky displayed its burning host, in
beautiful array.&nbsp; No breath of air disturbed the silent
slumbers of the peaceful woods.&nbsp; The lull of rippling waters
alone struck upon the ear, yielding a solemn tone like the deep
swell of the organ, breaking upon the deepest solitude.</p>
<p>In such a situation how indescribable is the feeling which
takes possession of us!&nbsp; What language can express, what
tongue can utter it?&nbsp; My very breathing seemed to disturb
the excessive sweetness of nature&rsquo;s melody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very pretty place, sir,&rdquo; said the
peasant, interrupting my reverie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose, sir, you&rsquo;ve been to visit the grave of
Gelert, Llewellyn&rsquo;s hound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have.&nbsp; Do you believe the legend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir, I do,&rdquo; said he with a sigh;
&ldquo;but I never thought a man could feel so much for the death
of a brute, until last year&mdash;<i>hai how</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This observation made me inquisitive to know what had so
suddenly changed his opinions.&nbsp; &ldquo;What has caused you,
my friend, to believe <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>in a legend so suddenly, which you
never gave any credence to before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why sir, I&rsquo;ll tell you; you must know that I had
a favourite pointer bitch, <i>Truan Bac</i>.&nbsp; Oh, she was
the beautifullest creature you ever saw.&nbsp; She was the pride
of the country; and gentlemen would come to me and say,
&lsquo;William, will you lend me your little bitch to go a
shooting on the mountains&mdash;<i>only for a day</i>?&nbsp;
Because you see, sir, there was not her equal in all Wales, for a
single dog; ay, and she&rsquo;d back as staunch as any on
&rsquo;em, and a better retriever never went into a field.&nbsp;
Such a nose! ah! poor wench; I never knew thy equal!&nbsp; You
must think, sir, I was very loath to let her go without me, for I
bred her, and broke her in&mdash;though very little breaking she
wanted;&mdash;and you know, sir, a good dog is soon spoilt by a
bad sportsman, and the creatures be as fond of a good shot, as he
be fond of shooting to a good dog.&nbsp; No day was too long for
her when the scent lay.&nbsp; The motion of your hand was enough
for her; to the right, or left, or take the fences.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;d never baulk her game, or make a false point; if the
birds had just gone off, you might know she was doubtful by a
<i>leetle</i> motion in her <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>tail.&nbsp; But, if she stood stiff
and staunch, you might bet a guinea to a mushroom that there was
game before her, and you&rsquo;d nothing to do but to go up and
take your shot.&nbsp; Down she was to charge, and, if you bade
her, she would bring your bird without ruffling a feather.&nbsp;
Well, sir, the beginning of last August unfortunately she had a
litter of pups.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a cross breed,
<i>ysywaith</i>!&mdash;and I got the butcher&rsquo;s boy to
destroy them, which he did, and buried them in the muck heap, at
the back of the stable.&nbsp; From that time, she would never
stir from her bed, that was under the manger.&nbsp; My dame took
her her food as usual, and placed it just inside the stable
door.&nbsp; My little boy, Billy, went next day, with a mess of
potatoes and barley meal, but told his mother that Rose
had&rsquo;nt eat up her yesterday&rsquo;s mess.&nbsp; Ah! she
cried, she&rsquo;ll eat it when she&rsquo;s hungry, I warrant
her.&nbsp; Billy went next evening, but her victuals were
untouched, and, when he went to coax her, she growled at him, and
showed her teeth&mdash;a thing she never in her life had done
before to any living being; so he was frightened, and told me of
it next morning, and I went to the stable to see her.&nbsp; Her
meat was all dried up in the tub, and, when I went to her, she
seemed nothing but skin and <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>bones.&nbsp; I called her Rose! poor
Rose! she slowly raised up her head, opened her bloodshot eyes,
and moaned so piteously!&nbsp; I thought she was dying.&nbsp; I
held her a little milk; she just moistened her tongue, and gave
one wag of her tail, as much as to say, thank you, master; and
her head dropt again, and her eyes closed.&nbsp; I knew
&rsquo;twas four days since she had eaten any thing.&nbsp; I put
some food by her, and went to my work.&nbsp; When I returned at
night, the first thing I did was to go into the stable, where I
found the food untouched and my poor little bitch dead, cold and
stiff.&nbsp; I shall never forget it&mdash;<i>wela</i>!
<i>wela</i>!&mdash;I drew her from under the manger, and what do
you think, sir?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be shot, if there warn&rsquo;t
her five little pups that the butcher&rsquo;s boy had
kill&rsquo;d!&mdash;she had dug them out of the dung-hill one by
one, and laid them in her kennel, and, fearing they would be
taken from her again she concealed them with her body, and died
through starvation, rather than give &rsquo;em up!&nbsp;
Wasn&rsquo;t that nature, sir?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m almost ashamed to
say it; but indeed, sir, I wiped away tears from my cheeks, when
I saw that sight.&nbsp; I took her up in my arms, and buried her
and her young litter in the same grave; and since that time I
never refuse my belief to the stories I hear of <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>surprising
instances of devoted affection, gratitude, and instinct, in any
of her race.&nbsp; <i>Wela</i>! <i>wela</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But sir, if you should come this way on your return,
and should want a day or two&rsquo;s good sport on the mountains,
I&rsquo;ve got a dog that&rsquo;s second to none in the country,
and I shall be proud to serve you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I promised, if I should find it convenient to return by the
first of September, to engage his dog, if not previously hired;
and bidding him follow me to the Goat, I ordered for him a
tumbler of whiskey-punch, which spirit is as much esteemed in
Snowdonia as in the mountains of Wicklow.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>T. J. Llewelyn Grichard</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning I quitted
the inn, where every attention was shewn that a traveller could
desire, and proceeded over the Ivy bridge, through which the
Gwynant flowed, <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>deep and smooth as glass, without an obstruction to
ruffle its clear waters, that glided along, kissing its verdant
banks, like the stream of a happy life.&nbsp; Quietude reigned in
this region uninterrupted.&nbsp; About half a mile from
Beddgelert, a rocky eminence projects into the road, called
<i>Vortigern&rsquo;s Hill</i>, or <i>Dinas Emrys</i>, a magician,
who was sent for to this place by Vortigern, when he found
himself hated by his subjects, and fled from their just anger to
this secluded spot.&nbsp; Passing this memorable place, a round
clump of rock attracts the eye, rising as it were in the centre
of the valley, and called <i>Moel Wynn</i>.&nbsp; Looking
backward, <i>Moel Hebog</i>, the Hawk hill, rises majestically
and closes up the entrance to Beddgelert.&nbsp; Moel Shebbod
towers in front, and, as we pursued our delightful path, about
two miles and a half from Beddgelert, an opening of the hills
upon the left displayed a deep gorge, and the base of Snowdon,
whose high peak, rising in the unclouded skies, held up the holy
symbol of Christianity, as in adoration of the Creator.&nbsp; At
length, I reached <i>Llynn Dinas</i>, a lake of about three
quarters of a mile in extent, through which the Gwynant runs; it
is surrounded by lofty mountains of a deeper tint than is usually
seen upon the Welsh hills.&nbsp; A <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>beautifully situated cottage here at
the far end of the lake, belonging to Mr. Sampson, nestles among
the protecting woods, and forms a delightful object.&nbsp; The
river which feeds the lake, winds through the verdant and
undulating grounds which form a miniature park, between the
cottage and the lake.&nbsp; Following up the course of the
stream, I left Llynn Dinas behind me, and proceeded by a gradual
ascent through the most delightful scenery I ever beheld, until I
caught glimpses through the plantations of</p>
<h3>LLYNN GWYNANT,</h3>
<p>and after a while beheld it stretching beneath me upon my left
hand.&nbsp; The valley forms a bowl among the hills.&nbsp; The
bottom is a small grassy plain, dotted with trees, which has
obtained the appellation of Beauty sleeping in the lap of
Terror.&nbsp; The mountains that surround the vale, have a wild
and rugged appearance.&nbsp; As I proceeded along the road
towards the head of the valley, a horn was sounded from the
mountain, and I perceived a Welsh girl standing upon a projecting
eminence: bare headed and bare footed, was this nymph of Cambria;
her cheeks were swelled out with her occupation, and she <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>looked like
a female <i>Boreas</i>, bursting with the wind she was sending
forth by degrees to alarm the <i>world</i>.</p>
<p>She eyed me with glances of curiosity all the while, and I
thought she could perhaps give me some information about the
valley, which might be interesting; so quitting the direct road,
I scrambled up the hill side, and asked her the meaning of her
sounding the horn so loudly?&nbsp; But she either did not, or
would not, understand me; and after vainly endeavouring to
extract any thing from her, I quietly sat myself down, delighted
by the splendid view beneath me, and gave vent to my feelings in
the following lines:</p>
<h3>LLYNN GWYNANT.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Llynn Gwynant, Llynn Gwynant! how bless&rsquo;d
should I be,<br />
When the winter of life crowns my temples with snow,<br />
To rest on thy margin, with her who loves me,<br />
And children whose love gathers strength as they grow.</p>
<p>There are mountains whose peaks rise more lofty by far,<br />
And valleys more spacious and fertile to view,<br />
But of all the high hills and green glens that there are,<br />
Llynn Gwynant give me, with its waters of blue.</p>
<p><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>Lynn
Gwynant, Lynn Gwynant! I bid thee farewell,<br />
Where peace in the beauty of solitude glows,<br />
Again in the cold hearted city to dwell,<br />
And pine for the calm of thy blissful repose.</p>
<p>Farewell to the lake with the surface of glass,<br />
Brown heath and blue mountains&mdash;abode of the free!<br />
This heart, like the flood from the high <i>Ffynnon Las</i>, <a
name="citation250"></a><a href="#footnote250"
class="citation">[250]</a><br />
Will leap from its gloom to find rapture in thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having nearly reached the extremity of this valley, I gazed,
from my elevated situation, upon the dark and perpendicular rocks
on the opposite side; and towering in the air immediately over
the centre of the valley was an eagle with expanded wings,
apparently motionless.&nbsp; Presently it rose a little higher,
but without the slightest visible exertion, then stooped again,
mounted once more, and, as fast as the eye could follow, swept
round the huge buttresses of sharp ridged cliffs, that hang over
the entrance of the pass of Llanberis.</p>
<p>As Llynn Gwynant is gradually shut out from the lingering gaze
of the traveller, (who it may <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>be said during the whole of the
ascent, should turn his eyes behind him), and he at length looks
forward in the direction of Llanberris, a new scene of grandeur
bursts upon him.&nbsp; He has left beauty behind in its loveliest
form;&mdash;but the sublime and wonderful now call forth all the
springs of admiration.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

 src="images/p251s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Snowdon again appears in all his splendor!&nbsp; Mountains
that by comparison looked like hillocks rise round his regal
waist, in groups numerous and picturesque.&nbsp; The deep black
crags that form the western side of the valley make a magnificent
fore-ground, and open here like nature&rsquo;s gates, to disclose
the secrets of her bosom.</p>
<p>The accompanying etching, gives an admirable idea of this
imposing scene.&nbsp; About a mile from hence is a place called
Gwrydd, where there is a small public house, with a sign
signifying nothing.&nbsp; Here I resolved to &ldquo;rough
it&rdquo; for a day, intending to fish the lakes, situated
immediately above this spot, as nature&rsquo;s cisterns to water
the pleasant valleys.</p>
<p>The public house possesses a small parlour, carpetted, with
half a dozen hair-bottomed chairs, and a mahogany table.&nbsp; A
silent but most importunate monitor urged me to discover <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>what food
this mountain chalet could produce.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eggs and
bacon,&rdquo; was the expected reply to my question; and I soon
had the pleasure of seeing this humble, but most grateful, fare
placed before me, and in spite of the indifferent style of the
cooking, I partook of it eagerly, having that incomparable sauce
&ldquo;a good appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After I had repaired my broken rod, I ascended the mountain at
the back of the house, and arrived at a large oval lake, in which
the black and sterile rocks that form inaccessible ramparts on
one side are reflected in its generally unruffled surface.&nbsp;
The scene is wild and desolate, such as Despair herself would
select for her abode.&nbsp; There are plenty of fish in this
lake, but they are all small and extremely shy.&nbsp; I remained
upon its margin until the shadows of night gave me warning to
attend to my safety, and make the best of my way to my lodging,
where I speedily ascended by a ladder-like staircase to a kind of
cock-loft which was divided into two compartments, one for the
accommodation of the family, man, wife, children and servants,
the other fitted up for travellers.&nbsp; Sleep soon overtook me,
and I should have continued <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>to sleep, I have no doubt, until
breakfast time, had I not been awakened by a trifling
accident.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the mid hour of night, when stars were
weeping,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and ghosts of the mighty walk upon the hills, with a variety
of other interesting objects that poets and nursery maids have
described infinitely better than I can pretend to do, I was
visited by a dream in which the ghost of a lobster popped his
head out of a salad bowl, and demanded upon what authority I had
presumed to make mince-meat of his body, when a loud crash roused
me from my slumber, and I found myself with my knees, doubled up
to my chin upon the floor; the bedstead having broken in the
middle, and deposited me in this unenviable position.&nbsp; I
need not say that for the remaining part of the night, I was
wholly left to waking reveries, and uncontrollable desires for
the blessings of daylight, which at last greeted my longing eyes,
and hurrying on my clothes, I descended and walked forth to scent
the morning air, in the direction of Llanberris.&nbsp; The mists
rolled like troubled lakes in the valleys, and the black bleak
rocks looked cheerless and forbidding.&nbsp; <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>The breeze
was keen and piercing, and I started at a round pace to get
myself warm by exercise.&nbsp; Having reached the summit of the
roadway, I plunged at once into the pass of Llanberis, wild and
gloomy.&nbsp; The precipices on my left looked truly terrible,
like the shadow of death wrapped in a vapoury shroud.&nbsp; This
pass is above four miles in length, and is a fine specimen of
rugged grandeur.&nbsp; Not a single tree enlivens with its
verdure this tremendous chasm.&nbsp; Range above range of rocks
tower over the traveller upon either side, bearing various tints
of black, brown, green and purple, according to the disposition
of the sun&rsquo;s rays, and the distances of the ponderous
masses.&nbsp; The rocks on both sides are nearly perpendicular;
and, about two miles down the pass, the tourist will perceive
some prodigious masses of rock upon his right hand that have
fallen from the overhanging cliffs, which, when he pauses to look
upon, will strike a feeling of terror into his heart, as he
inwardly exclaims, &ldquo;could any one have witnessed the
descent of this tremendous mass?&rdquo;&nbsp; The accompanying
sketch gives a most accurate description.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>I stood contemplating this scene, and suddenly a wild shout
roused me from my reverie.</p>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>&ldquo;Halloo, halloo!
over&mdash;over&mdash;over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned my eyes up the mountain to my left, and there saw a
shepherd, forming a speaking trumpet with his hands, and shouting
to a dog (of what kind heaven knows, but in my opinion a thorough
bred mongrel), and the fleet animal was dashing down the hill in
the direction to where I stood.&nbsp; In an instant, he had
passed me.&nbsp; It was a perfect nondescript! a thing that
looked like the offspring of a French poodle and a Welsh goat;
such a mass of hair, rags and wool, I never before beheld.&nbsp;
I sat watching his progress, which was exceedingly rapid, and as
I marked him, as he scrambled up the opposite craggs, I could not
help admiring the instinct (or training) of the wretched looking
animal.&nbsp; Sheep after sheep did it pursue, and drive down
into the hollow from which they had strayed&mdash;some of them
leading him a chase (of no enviable description) nearly to the
summit of the barren mountain; but, with untired feet and
unceasing bark, he tracked and outstripped them all, and, in
conclusion, forced them into the bounds allotted for them at the
bottom of the vale, where a scanty supply of grass served for
them to browse upon.&nbsp; This duty done, the <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>faithful
animal left them, and again crossing the valley, rushed by me and
rejoined his master.</p>
<p>I was about to pursue my journey, when I perceived a man
fishing in the stream beneath.&nbsp; I descended to learn what
sport he had met with, and found he had not been fortunate.&nbsp;
I asked him if he remembered the time, when the huge rock, I have
before noticed, fell from the brow of the precipice?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be hard for me to do that, sir,&rdquo; said
the fisherman, who laying his rod upon the ground, seemed
desirous of saying something more upon the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any legend about it?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir, there is,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;and,
if you&rsquo;ll only stop till I put up my tackle, as I suppose
you&rsquo;re going to Llanberis, I&rsquo;ll tell you as much as I
know about the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remarked, as he spoke, an expression of countenance that
told me he thought tale telling might prove more profitable than
trout fishing; but I readily agreed to his proposition, and in a
few minutes we were trudging, side by side, along the road
towards the village.</p>
<p>I dare say, sir, you havn&rsquo;t come so far, without seeing
<i>Cader Idris</i>, or the <i>Chair of Idris</i>, <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>as it is
called, for Idris <i>Gawr</i> you must know, sir, was a famous
giant of his day, but whether you have or not, he had a brother,
sir, as I&rsquo;ve been told, <i>Dyn Ddu o&rsquo;r&rsquo;
Craig</i>, which means the black man of the craig, who had a very
fine castle upon the top of that precipice, at the foot of which
you noticed those large pieces of rock.&nbsp; Well, sir, he never
loved his brother, but he had a great liking for his niece; one
of the prettiest girls, &rsquo;twas thought, ever seen in this
part of the country; but she was to be married to a fine young
hero, one of the knights of King Arthur&rsquo;s round table, who
had done wonders for her sake, and made all the world confess
<i>Merch Idris</i> was the most beautiful creature in the
world.</p>
<p>Well, sir, she was mortally afraid of her uncle, for he had a
head as big as the top of Snowdon, and a forest of whiskers, and
a beard that a man might take a day&rsquo;s shooting in, without
tearing his coat with the branches; so that he never could be
conquered, having so much game in him, ha! ha!
ha!&mdash;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir, but what a comfortable
thing it must be for a man to catch birds enough in his whiskers,
to serve him for dinner!&mdash;Well, sir, it happened that Merch
Idris was benighted <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>between Capel Curig and her
father&rsquo;s castle, and, as she had only one attendant, and he
was a poor weak coward, you may easily suppose she was for
getting home as fast as possible; but a storm came on, and the
night closed round them, and by some means or other they lost
their way; for you know, sir, at that time there were no turnpike
roads, as there are now, and they wandered about upon their
merlins until nightfall, without knowing what part of the world
they were in; when all of a sudden, the servant&rsquo;s beast,
who went first, sank into a bog, up to his neck; and his rider
began to roar for help so loudly, that the lady&rsquo;s animal
took fright, set off at full speed, and never stopped until they
came to the gates of a large castle.&nbsp; The night was so dark,
she couldn&rsquo;t make out whether she had ever seen it before
or not; however, she thought it would be better to blow the horn
at the gate, and ask for shelter, than wander about the mountains
all night, at the risk of breaking her neck, or being smothered
in a quagmire.&nbsp; So she blew a blast (for at that time
o&rsquo; day every great lady played upon some instrument or
other, and this young lady surpassed all others upon the horn) so
loud, that presently a warden called out from the top of a <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>tower.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Well, she mustered up courage enough to say, she was &ldquo;A
lady in great distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; says the warden, and off he set.&nbsp; Now
the young lady scarcely knew how to take the salutation of the
warden, whether it was meant friendly or otherwise.&nbsp; She had
not pondered long upon those mysterious sounds, when the
portcullis was raised, and the first living thing she saw was her
tremendous uncle Dyn Ddu o&rsquo;r&rsquo; Craig! with a hundred
torches behind him, ready to welcome her into his castle.&nbsp;
You may be sure she was not much pleased at his presence, and
regretted that she had not held out till the morning.&nbsp; But
she had gone too far, and so she went in, and the iron grating
was closed again, with a sound that struck terror into her pretty
heart.&nbsp; Now it so happened that Sir Tristram (that was the
name of her lover) was staying with her father, Idris Gawr; and
they were both of them puzzled what to think when Merch Idris
didn&rsquo;t reach home at the time they expected her.&nbsp; So
the knight mounted his charger and gallopped off one way, and
Idris took up his club and walked off the other, to search for
her.&nbsp; All this time, the villain of an uncle was trying to
wheedle the fair <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>maid, his niece, to marry him; and, when he found her
deaf to his monstrous wishes, he flew into a mighty passion, and
dragged her to the top of the precipice, by the hair of her head,
and swore, in a most unchristian manner, that he would pitch her
over, if she didn&rsquo;t consent.</p>
<p>But just as he was about to put his threat into execution, he
heard a horse at full gallop behind him; so he turned round just
time enough to avoid the slashing sword of Sir Tristram, who made
a determined cut at his head, that would have taken it clean off,
if he hadn&rsquo;t have ducked.&nbsp; Well, he was fain to let go
the lady to save himself from the fury of the knight, although he
didn&rsquo;t think much of him.&nbsp; But he pulled up a tree,
and he made a mighty blow at him, which the knight, by the
blessing of providence, escaped; but the horse wasn&rsquo;t so
fortunate, for it fell upon the poor creature&rsquo;s head, and
smashed it to atoms.&nbsp; Well, the knight began to think the
giant &ldquo;too much of a horse&rdquo; for him; and so he blew
three notes upon his bugle, which was the appointed signal
between him and Idris, and no sooner had he done so, than it was
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Sir Tristram, &ldquo;my fine
fellow, <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>you&rsquo;ll have your match in a minute; and sure
enough, as he spoke, Dyn Ddu o&rsquo;r&rsquo; Craig saw his
brother running at the rate of half a mile a stride.&nbsp; Well,
he was greatly perplexed what to do; but he thought he had better
get into the castle.&nbsp; So, he took Merch Idris under his left
arm, and kept the knight off with the roots of the tree.&nbsp;
However, he couldn&rsquo;t reach the gates in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; says Idris to his brother, &ldquo;you
ruffian,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;what are you going to do with my
daughter?&nbsp; Put her down, or I&rsquo;ll smash you, as I do
this tower!&rdquo; and with that he hit a turret of the castle,
and it flew about in all directions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
then,&rdquo; says the other, &ldquo;I think I can do as great a
feat as that.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he knocked the other turret on the
head, and drove it clean down into the earth, so that not a brick
of it was seen above ground!&nbsp; Well, with that the two giants
began to bang each other with their cudgels, till they were black
and blue, while Sir Tristram and the lady ran off to Cader Idris,
as fast as they could, to get out of harm&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>Idris was the stronger giant of the two, and after three
hours&rsquo; hard fighting, you wouldn&rsquo;t have known them
for human beings; but Idris <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>having got Dyn with his back to the
precipice, (where he threatened to throw the poor young lady
over) hit him, with all his force, such a blow on the nose as
made him stagger back and roll right over the edge of the
craig.&nbsp; Well, he rolled and he rolled, till he got to the
place where you were standing, and then he stopped; but he was
quite dead.&nbsp; Then the famous Idris, seeing his brother lie
like a huge bundle of rags, without motion, by the side of the
stream, tore off a large piece from the top of the mountain, and
throwing it with great force, it lit full upon the giant as he
lay, while his conqueror roared out, in a voice that was heard at
Carnaervon,&mdash;&ldquo;Good rest to you, brother Dyn!
there&rsquo;s a nightcap for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And ever since, that piece of rock has been called &ldquo;the
Giant&rsquo;s Nightcap.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We soon obtained a view of the lakes that spread themselves
before us&mdash;viz.: Lyn Peris and Lyn Padarn, with the romantic
castle of Dolbadarn upon its rocky promontory.&nbsp; On issuing
from a pass on our left, as my companion informed me, is a
valuable copper mine, and a stream of water conveyed over the
road, <a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>by
the aid of a wooden conduit, into the lake, which stream, he
said, was for the use of the mine.</p>
<p>At length, I reached the inn, called Victoria, and satisfying
my companion with a gratuity which was more profitable than
fishing, I entered and ordered breakfast, and procured an
admittance to the castle of Dolbadarn.&nbsp; This ancient
fortress is supposed to have been built by one Padarn Beisrydd ap
Idwal, for the purpose of guarding the mountain pass which I had
just quitted.&nbsp; A single round tower is all that remains of
the castle, although traces are left of a much more extensive
building.&nbsp; Here Owen Goch was imprisoned twenty years by his
brother Llewellyn, the last Prince of Wales of the British line;
and an ode is still extant, written by Howel-Voel, wherein his
captivity is affectionately lamented.</p>
<p>The view from the castle is truly sublime, comprising the two
lakes, and the tremendous range of mountains, that seem to admit
no outlet from the vale.&nbsp; But the most beautiful prospect is
from the lake in front of the promontory on which the castle
stands, and is reflected in the smooth waters beneath, while the
majestic Snowdon towers in the distance.</p>
<p>In the twelfth century, it is said there lived a celebrated
beauty, whose father was the lord of <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>this castle, and of whom something
like the following legend is related:</p>
<h3>LEGEND OF DOLBADARN.</h3>
<p>Margaret of Dolbadarn was one of the fairest damsels of whom
Cambria ever boasted at court or tourney;&mdash;fair without
vanity, highborn without ostentation, she exhibited the
simplicity of nobility.</p>
<p>Like others of her rank, she had many knights who owned her
power, and panted to put lance in rest for the peerless Margaret;
but in the number there was but one whom her eye followed through
the glittering throng, and whose approach made her heart beat,
and the mounting blood turn the delicate pink upon her cheek to
crimson; and William of Montgomery was the happy knight.</p>
<p>But her father had other views, and Hector of March-lyn-Mawr
was proposed by him to be her husband&mdash;a youth of noble
presence, but ignoble mind.&nbsp; His lands extended far and
near, and skirted those of the Lord of Dolbadarn, who was, from
that circumstance, doubly anxious to have the union
consummated.</p>
<p>He was, however, a tender guardian; he <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>loved his
daughter, and was by her loved tenderly in return.&nbsp; Both
knights had free access to Margaret, and both were anxious to
deserve her favour.&nbsp; William was young, valiant, handsome,
and honest; Hector was bold, gloomy, uncourtly and subtle.&nbsp;
The Baron saw the decided preference his daughter gave to William
of Montgomery, and grieved in his heart that it was not bestowed
upon his more wealthy rival.&nbsp; He therefore resolved to put a
proposal to his daughter, which was, that at the ensuing
tournament to be given at his castle, the knights should prove
their skill upon each other, and that he who was proclaimed the
most accomplished master of his weapons, should receive her hand
as the reward.&nbsp; For, though he was desirous of an alliance
with the wealthy and powerful house of March Lyn Mawr, he was by
no means insensible to the merits of Montgomery, whose name stood
high in the lists of chivalry, and whose engaging manners won
friends for him wherever he appeared.&nbsp; With a heavy heart
did Margaret submit to the proposal of her father, although a
feeling of confidence within her bosom told her the object of her
attachment would prove the victor.&nbsp; Far different emotions
agitated the hearts of the rivals, when they were informed of the
Baron&rsquo;s determination.&nbsp; <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>William of Montgomery flung himself
upon his knees before the old man, exclaiming with
enthusiasm,</p>
<p>&ldquo;By bath, and bed, and white chemise, <a
name="citation266"></a><a href="#footnote266"
class="citation">[266]</a> I will for ever be a true knight to
thee for this especial favour, my good Lord of Dolbadarn!&nbsp;
My lance and blade are yours at command, and,&rdquo; turning to
his rival, &ldquo;Hector, if I bear thee not over thy
charger&rsquo;s croup, why say my heart and hand shook with fear
in the encounter.&mdash;But, if thou gainest the field,
I&rsquo;ll give thee a grey palfrey for thy bride, to bear her to
the church yonder, by thy side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Hector; &ldquo;and noble Lord of
Dolbadarn, if heaven desert me not in the hour of trial, I doubt
not my success in winning thy daughter for my bride.&nbsp; Yet,
should I fail, I promise thee, William of Montgomery, to give
thee a steed, fleeter than any in thy stables, to bear the Lady
Margaret as thy bride to church, nor will I bear thee any ill
will shouldst thou prove conqueror, but drink a health to thee
and thine, with a kind heart and true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, there dwelt an old woman in the pass of
Llanberis who was dreaded by all the country people, for she was
accounted a witch; <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>and on the night of that same day the storm raged
furiously, and the tall trees were cracking in the forest, when a
horseman was seen galloping up the pass.&nbsp; He stopped at the
witch&rsquo;s hut, and knocking loudly, he cried, &ldquo;Ho!
mother witch! open the door! for thy devil&rsquo;s counsel is
needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was then opened, and the knight fastened his
coal-black steed, dripping with rain and sweat, to a withered
ash, and strode into the cabin.&nbsp; The fire reflected in his
suit of steel made him appear a knight of flame; and, as he
stamped his armed heels upon the floor, his armour rang with a
muffled sound, like the death bell which tolls for the great, who
die in the odour of sanctity: and the old hag laughed; her spirit
was glad&mdash;for she knew that a deed of damning crime was
shortly to be committed!</p>
<p>He sat him down upon the three-legged stool, and said,
&ldquo;Dame, I am ill at ease; for I love a maid whose heart I
cannot win.&nbsp; Attend to me;&mdash;the gallant and high-minded
Montgomery I must encounter for her in the lists; and, should he
conquer, he will bear away the prize I am burning to possess;
but, if the chance be mine, her own consent waits on her
father&rsquo;s choice, whose wishes are for me.&nbsp; Doubts on
the issue <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>urge me to seek thy aid.&nbsp; May my saint desert me
if I would not rather shake hands with the foul fiend himself,
than give a palfrey for my Margaret to ride to church upon, with
any but myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The witch laughed aloud, till he jumped from the stool, to see
her old sides shake.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hector of March Lyn
Mawr,&rdquo; quoth she, &ldquo;fear not that Margaret of
Dolbadarn will ever become the bride of Montgomery; for shouldst
thou be overcome in the lists, (and my power will not assist thee
in the joust) call aloud &lsquo;Hell kite! hell kite!&rsquo; and
presently shall a gallant palfrey come and raise thee from the
ground, which being done, present it to thy foe, and thou shalt
see the issue.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thanked her, dropped his purse
upon the floor, mounted his steed, and vanished down the
pass.</p>
<p>There was a great assemblage of people at the castle of
Dolbadarn, to witness the jousting; and knights from all quarters
arrived, to break a lance with merry England&rsquo;s best, for
glory and lady love.</p>
<p>The tilting ground was enclosed by galleries erected for the
ladies and nobles who wished to be spectators of the games.&nbsp;
Upon the plain, at the end of the vale, fifty shields were hung
up <a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>by
the knights who wished to signalize themselves.&nbsp; Three score
of coursers, with a squire of honour, first entered the lists;
then followed as many knights in jousting harness, led in silver
chains, by the same number of ladies, richly clad, to the sound
of clarions, and trumpets, and minstrelsy.&nbsp; When the ladies
ascended the galleries, the squires dismounted, and the knights
vaulted gaily into their saddles.&nbsp; The scaffoldings were
hung with tapestry, and embroideries of gold and silver; and the
scene was animated and costly in the extreme.&nbsp; Joy lighted
up the eyes of all, save those of Margaret and her two
lovers.&nbsp; She sat a lily among roses, pale and
dejected.&nbsp; Sometimes, indeed, she lifted her dark eyes, and
her snowy neck took for a moment the carnation&rsquo;s hue when
she beheld the form of Montgomery, which yet faded as quickly as
it came, and the Parian marble was left pure as before.</p>
<p>Sir William walked, with a bold and lofty mien, along the line
of shields, glancing at them with indifference, until he stopped
before that which bore the arms of Hector, and then a smile of
scorn played upon his lips, and he passed on.&nbsp; Hector marked
that smile, and his cheeks flushed with anger.&nbsp; Great skill
was <a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>displayed by youthful knights decked in ladies&rsquo;
favours.&nbsp; But, when the time arrived for the trial between
Sir William of Montgomery and Hector of March Lyn Mawr, a hum of
unusual interest arose among the gallant and beauteous
auditory.&nbsp; From the opposed lists they passed each other, to
determine the length of the course, with visors up.&nbsp; Sir
William smiled gaily, but Hector wore a sad and mournful look, as
though he feared or doubted the event of the trial.</p>
<p>This ceremony of preparation being over, each took his post
assigned, awaiting the signal for the charge.&nbsp; The Lady
Margaret was pale as death, but none around her noticed it, they
being all intent upon the two knights, who wore no outward
favours, though one possessed an amulet which he had placed near
his heart, beneath his vest.&nbsp; It was a white rose, which the
fair Margaret had taken from her bosom, and given him an hour
before in secret.</p>
<p>The nominal prize for the victor was a jewelled sword, but the
prize on which their hearts were set was a gem
transcendant&mdash;the all-surpassing Margaret!</p>
<p>And now the heralds sounded the charge, and the combatants met
in mid career.&nbsp; The lance <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>of Hector was shivered upon the
breast of Montgomery; but Sir William&rsquo;s struck full upon
the visor of Hector, which made him bend his plume
backwards.&nbsp; In the second course, Hector struck the coronal
of Sir William&rsquo;s helmet a skilful stroke.&nbsp; Margaret
fainted, and the ladies about her were busy in applying
restoratives; but none attempted to remove her, being too much
interested in the event of the joust.&nbsp; Montgomery cast a
look of fire up to the spot, and then re-closed his visor for the
third course.&nbsp; His opponent was resolved to make it a
decisive one.&nbsp; Striking their spurs into their
chargers&rsquo; sides, like arrows shot from opposing bows, they
flew along.&nbsp; Then was a clash, a glittering flash! and the
prize was won&mdash;for Hector of March Lyn Mawr lay, stunned and
motionless, upon the ground, borne from his saddle by the lance
of the victorious Sir William of Montgomery!</p>
<p>Margaret, being restored to her senses, wept tears of joy, and
spoke most sweet words, when her lover riding beneath the
platform, demanded from her hand the honourable prize.</p>
<p>But a wonder now appeared, which turned all eyes to the spot
where Hector lay o&rsquo;erthrown; for a milk-white palfrey, of
the most exquisite <a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>form, had galloped into the lists, and drawn him from
beneath his charger, which had fallen with him in the violent
concussion.&nbsp; His helmet being loosed, he soon partially
recovered, and seeing the beautiful animal frisking and
curvetting, as though overjoyed at his escape, he led it by the
mane to his rival, saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;William of Montgomery, I give to thee this
palfrey.&nbsp; Present it to thy bride, to whom I now resign all
claim, and only request that she will, for my sake, let my
favourite bear her to the church, where your union is to be
celebrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a lovely thing to look upon, and the maiden promised to
use no other on that happy day.</p>
<p>The church of Llanberis was, at this time, about a mile from
the castle of Dolbadarn, and the road, upon the bridal morning,
resembled a mosaic pavement, when viewed from the mountain, it
was so thickly studded with the fantastic dresses of the company,
spectators, and gay flags and streamers waving in the air.&nbsp;
The minstrels struck up their boldest notes of war, or delighted
the ears and hearts of the female holiday makers with the soft
songs of love.&nbsp; All was mirth, feasting, and jollity, while
the air <a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>rung with the combined names of Margaret of Dolbadarn
and William of Montgomery.</p>
<p>At length, the bridal procession issued forth from the castle
gateway; the heralds led, the minstrels followed.&nbsp; Then came
comely maidens with baskets of flowers, which they strewed around
them, as they passed along.&nbsp; A body of armed knights
followed and after them their esquires.&nbsp; Then appeared a
troop of dancing girls, adorned with flowers, and clad in purest
white; and a second band of minstrels struck their harps before
the bridegroom and the happy bride, who rode gaily, side by
side.&nbsp; She was dressed in rich attire; jewels glittered upon
her robes and in her hair; and she rode upon the beautiful steed
presented by March Lyn Mawr.&nbsp; The palfrey seemed proud of
its lovely burthen, and gentle as the unwearied lamb.&nbsp; The
bridegroom was clad in a light tunic and hose, and peaked boots;
a many-coloured plume fluttered in his bonnet, and many sweet
words did he whisper in Margaret&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; As the
assembled multitude shouted their gratulations, he bent even to
his saddle bow, to thank them for their courtesy.&nbsp; Young
Hector rode upon her left, and he laughed, too, and he bowed low;
but in his laugh there was a fiendish sound, and in his <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>bow a
scorn.&nbsp; Then followed the Lord of Dolbadarn, his long white
locks waving in the summer breeze, surrounded by his relatives
and friends.&nbsp; A troop of squires and pages followed, while
all the retainers of his noble house brought up the rear.</p>
<p>The bride and bridegroom passed along, and thousands cheered
them on their way, with shouts and praises.&nbsp; The sun shone
brightly above their heads, and joy was in their hearts.&nbsp; On
they went, until a turning in the road brought them at once in
sight of the church; but here the palfrey grew restive, and Sir
William seized the bridle, thinking to control him.&nbsp; This
answered but for a short distance; for they had no sooner reached
the gate, over which was carved a cross, than, even while the
groom held the stirrup for her to alight, away, away, away flew
the palfrey, like a falcon, down the wind.&nbsp; The Lady
Margaret was a good horsewoman, but she could not control the
enchanted steed.&nbsp; She, however, kept her seat well, and
hoped the unruly animal would soon relax his speed.</p>
<p>A hundred horsemen galloped after her, the bridegroom taking
the lead, who, being mounted on the swiftest horse, soon left the
rest behind, <a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>although unable yet to overtake the bride.&nbsp; The
palfrey first dashed forward in the direction of Carnaervon, but
suddenly turned off to the right, and galloped up the
mountain.&nbsp; Hundreds of the peasantry were trampled under
foot by the horses of the pursuers; some bruised, some crippled,
and some killed, while the old Lord of Dolbadarn wrung his
withered hands, and tore his grey locks, in frantic agony.&nbsp;
He accused Hector as the author of all this misery, and vented
his curses upon him, which the infuriated mob hearing, they
seized upon the astonished knight, and almost in an instant
tossed him upon their spikes into the air.&nbsp; He fell to the
ground again, but not to rise; his plume, besmeared with blood,
was scattered in every direction; his body, pierced with twenty
wounds, spouted forth blood in fountains; blows fell upon his
harness thick as hail; while a ferocious smith, with one stroke
of an axe, severed the head from the body, and placing it upon a
pike, bore the dripping trophy of vengeance above the applauding
and infuriated wretches who had suffered in the tumult.</p>
<p>Those who could govern their horses flew over the broken
country in pursuit, while fleeter than a startled hind, the
palfrey dashed along&mdash;<a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>at times abating his swift flight,
to give the laggards hope, who furiously spurred their chargers
forward</p>
<blockquote><p>After the knight,<br />
And lady bright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But away, away flew the enchanted steed over moss and moor,
o&rsquo;er hill and dale, through ford and forest; while of those
who followed up the chase some were smothered, horse and rider,
in the deep morass; some broke their necks in attempting to leap
stone walls; some dangled from the boughs in woody dell, or
perished in the river, dashed by the torrent against broken
rocks; and they cursed, and died as they cursed.</p>
<p>But Sir William of Montgomery pricked on his horse all
foaming, and, as the strength of the noble animal began to fail,
he cried aloud upon his patron saint to aid him.&nbsp; It was a
charm of power, for it was a holy one; and the creature shook the
foam from his mouth, and with recovered strength, dashed on in
the pursuit.&nbsp; That charm, too, struck upon the heart of the
palfrey, which began to fail him, and he tried in vain to keep
the speed he had hitherto maintained.&nbsp; But the impetuous
knight, seeing that he gained upon his lady love, furiously urged
on <a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>his
charger, and with desperate rashness, burying his rowels in his
side, exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Hell kite, speed
on!&rdquo;&mdash;the very words the witch had given as a charm to
Hector, and the name of the palfrey.</p>
<p>No sooner was it pronounced, than his speed returned, and
away, away the enchanted steed rushed on, as swiftly as
before!&nbsp; The lady was, by this time, nearly senseless; her
eyes were dimmed from the effect of the air, as she cut through
it; and her heart trembled within her, like a fluttering
dove.&nbsp; She cast an imploring look behind upon her lover, and
raised one snowy arm beseechingly.&nbsp; He saw the action, and
fancied he heard her voice, faintly calling upon him for
aid.&nbsp; But it was to Him who governs all, she prayed; and
again the wild horse felt the sacred power.&nbsp; But he had
nearly reached the goal.&nbsp; With voice and spur the gallant
knight pressed on up the rising ground, the summit of which,
unknown to Margaret, or the knight, looked over the broad
ocean;&mdash;it was the terrific Penman Maur.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer did the knight approach; his charger&rsquo;s
foam was on the palfrey&rsquo;s flanks.&nbsp; Another bound, and
he was at the side of Margaret&mdash;another, and there was one
loud wild scream <a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>that startled the eagles from their nests.&nbsp;
Montgomery had clasped his lady round her waist, and borne her to
his saddle bow.&nbsp; It was the movement of an
instant&mdash;but, in that instant, steeds, knight, and lady
plunged from the precipice&rsquo;s edge!&nbsp; The first fall of
fifty feet crushed the palfrey and war-horse; and the foul
spirit, quitting the enchanted steed, like a dark cormorant
hovered over the group.</p>
<p>The knight still clasped the maiden in his arms, whose shrieks
were answered by the eagles&rsquo; screams; and the lovers were
dashed from rock to rock, battered and bloody.&nbsp; The maiden
fainted; but Sir William held her with the tenacious grasp of
despair, with one arm to his breast, and with his right hand
seized a dwarfish thorn&mdash;the only one that grew out of the
rifted rock!&nbsp; But still there was no resting place for feet
to stand upon, while the broken fragments of the cliff, disturbed
by the weight of the fall, thundered downwards from above, and
around them in every direction.&nbsp; One large mass struck the
unhappy knight; the fragile thorn gave way, and the next moment
beheld the loving pair, mutilated carcasses, floating upon the
reckless waves!&nbsp; The eagles gorged upon their flesh, and not
a vestige of the lost ones <a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>was left.&nbsp; A white scarf which
Margaret wore, and which streamed, like the banner of death, from
the blasted thorn, alone remained to tell the fate of Sir William
of Montgomery, and his blooming bride!</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Returning</span> to the Victoria, I
partook of the refreshments provided, and then retracing my
steps, I visited the little rustic church of Llanberis, which,
for its simplicity, is well worthy of attention.&nbsp; Upon
entering the doorway, there <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>is a small stone font placed upon a
pedestal which is approached by three stone steps: it resembles a
small washing tub, and its cover is much like a copper-lid.&nbsp;
Advancing into the interior, the music loft is upon the left,
under which is a dilapidated screen, opposite to the font.&nbsp;
A doorway in the centre of the screen leads into the body of the
church, where ancient oaken benches are ranged upon either side,
and the pulpit and communion table are immediately in
front.&nbsp; The old arched roof is held together by iron pins,
which project on each side of the timbers, and the whole interior
is whitewashed.&nbsp; The only pew in the church adjoins the
communion table, both of which have suffered materially by the
worm and time.&nbsp; The few monuments in this simple structure
are upon small slate slabs, about the size of a
school-boy&rsquo;s, and are hung up on the wooden beams.&nbsp;
There are two of wood, with letters cut deeply into the small
square, thus:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Ina<br />
Tan! hun!&nbsp; Ofe! mae<br />
Gorwedd!&nbsp; Corph<br />
ROE! ei oed! 60<br />

</blockquote>
<p><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>The
other, immediately facing the pulpit, is a black piece of board,
ornamented with an undertaker&rsquo;s tablet of gilt copper, in
the centre of which, upon black japan, is&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Thos. Williams<br />

</blockquote>
<p>On leaving the church, there is a monumental slate slab on the
left of the path, bearing the following inscription and
verses:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Underneath<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Upon returning to my inn at Gwrydd, I discovered that the
landlady was sister to little John Closs; and from her I learnt
the story of his melancholy fate.&nbsp; It is as follows:</p>
<p>John was a pretty boy, about seven years of age, with fair
hair and blue eyes, of a sweet-temper, adored by his parents, and
loving them most affectionately in return.&nbsp; Indeed, little
John Closs was the talk of the parish, and held up as a pattern
of filial love and reverence to all the children in the
village.&nbsp; His uncle had a small farm at Nant Bettwys; and
John&rsquo;s father having sent him to reside there, for a few
months, the fond mother would often cross the mountain to see her
son and her sister, returning home in the evening of the same
day.&nbsp; Little John got tired of living away from home, and
one night, after his mother had quitted the cottage to return to
Llanberis, he wept so bitterly, and prayed so earnestly to be
permitted to follow her home, that the good people at Bettwys
permitted him to try and overtake her, <a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>which they
considered he might easily do, as she had not left the house ten
minutes before he started.</p>
<p>The mother reached Llanberis in safety; but the poor boy lost
his way in a snow storm on Moel Einion, and was not heard of for
more than a week afterwards; when, one day, a man crossing the
mountain, found the child stretched on the ground in a slumbering
position, his face towards the earth, buried in his hands, and
quite dead.</p>
<p>On the evening when he lost his way, a shepherd, by the name
of John Davis, said he had heard cries, like those of a child,
upon the mountain, which in his ignorance he believed to be the
voice of a fairy; and, terrified at the idea of encountering some
supernatural being, he took to his heels in a contrary direction,
with all the speed he could make, while the poor sufferer, cold
and dying, vainly exerted himself in straining his innocent voice
for succour.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of this neighbourhood have, from time
immemorial, held a strong belief in fairies; and there are many
families now living that are said to have descended from this
race, from their having intermarried, in the olden time, with
their ancestors.&nbsp; They are called <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>Pellings,
from a fairy who was named Penelope, and who, while dancing, one
moonlight night, upon the shores of a lake called Cwellyn, was
surprised and seized by a young farmer, who, in spite of her
screams, bore her to his own house, called Yestrad, near Bettws,
where he treated her with so much kindness, that she became
contented to live with him; and they were married, upon the
condition that he should never strike her with iron; for if he
did, she would vanish, and he would never see her again.&nbsp; (I
here thought of the tale told me by the old man in the valley of
Drwstynrnt and was struck with the similarity they bore to each
other.)&nbsp; Unfortunately, as the farmer and his wife went out
into the field one day, to catch his horse, he accidentally hit
her with the buckle of his bridle, and she was never seen
after.&nbsp; Her descendants are called Pellings, as are all who
imagine they derive their origin from this fabulous lady.&nbsp;
Mr. William Williams, in his observations upon the Snowdon
mountains, says&mdash;&ldquo;The best blood in my own veins is
this fairy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This belief, existing so strongly in the breasts of many
people in this district, will account for the pusillanimity of
the shepherd who fled from the cries of poor little John
Closs.</p>
<p><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>The
following morning, I proceeded towards Capel Curig, but this road
is very uninteresting.&nbsp; The tourist is, however, amply
gratified, if it happen to be tolerably clear weather, on his
arrival at an ancient stone bridge which crosses a stream that
tumbles over some black rocks on the right, and winds its way in
graceful variety, forming a pleasing spot to rest upon.&nbsp;
Looking back towards Llanberis, the mountain scenery is very
fine; and I here took my farewell look of Snowdon and
Snowdonia.</p>
<h3>CAPEL CURIG</h3>
<p>Is in the parish of Llandegai.&nbsp; It derives its name from
a man who was canonized, and founded a chapel in this mountainous
region.&nbsp; He was the son of Llendden Llenddog, of
Edinburgh.&nbsp; There are here two lakes, and some tolerable
fishing may be had, if you take a boat; but from the banks it is
quite useless to attempt it.&nbsp; From this spot, excursions may
be made to Llanberis and</p>
<h3>MOEL SIABOD,</h3>
<p>From the summit of which a magnificent view is obtained of the
mountains of Snowdonia, of <a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>nine different lakes, and the sea
beyond Carnaervon.&nbsp; The distance from the inn to the apex of
this mountain does not exceed three miles and a half.</p>
<h3>DOLWYDDELAN CASTLE,</h3>
<p>Situated about five miles from Capel Curig, and on the
eastward side of Moel Siabod, deserves notice.&nbsp; It is built
upon a lofty rock, which on one side is inaccessible.&nbsp; There
are two square towers, and a court in the middle.&nbsp; It is
surrounded by mountains, and must in ancient days have been a
fortress of considerable importance.&nbsp; It is said, Llewellyn
the great was born in the castle; and this fact is sufficient to
interest the stranger who is capable of appreciating and feeling
reverence for a hero, who so long struggled with unwearied
assiduity and unconquerable bravery, for his native land, and who
fought and died in the sacred cause of liberty.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Within four miles of Capel Curig is an oval lake, of about
three miles in circumference, called <i>Llyn Ogwen</i>, which
must by no means be overlooked.&nbsp; The scenery around is
delightful, <a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>and the waters are well stored with excellent trout of
fine flavour, and surpassing all others in that respect, in the
Carnaervonshire lakes.</p>
<p>At the western end of this lake, are the falls of
<i>Benglog</i>, (being three in number and upwards of one hundred
feet in height) from whence the waters take their course through
Beavers&rsquo; Hollow, a wild and romantic glen, rocky and
barren.</p>
<p>Powel, in his History of North Wales, says, &ldquo;In Tevi,
above all the rivers in Wales, were, in Giraldus&rsquo;s time, a
great number of castels, which may be Englished beavers, and are
called in Welsh avane, which name onlie remaineth in Wales at
this daie, but what it is, very few can tell.&nbsp; It is a beast
not much unlike an otter, but that it is bigger, all hearie
saving the taile, which is like a fishe taile as broad as a
man&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; This beast useth as well the water as the
land; and hath a voice, sharp teeth, and biteth cruellie till he
perceives the bones cracke * * * * He that will learn what strong
nests they make, which Giraldus calleth castells, which they
build upon the face of the water with great bowes, which they cut
with their teeth, and how some lie upon their backs holding the
wood with their fore feet, which the other draweth <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>with a
crosse stick, the which he holdeth in his mouth, to the
water&rsquo;s side, and other particularities of their natures,
let him read Giraldus in his Topographie of Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this stream are found the fresh water muscle, which the
country people call <i>cregyn deluw</i>, i.e. <i>shells of the
deluge</i>, supposed to have been brought into it by Noah&rsquo;s
flood.</p>
<p>On the left of the lake are the <i>Crags of Trifaen</i>; huge
shattered ridges, which overhang the pool and keep it in
continual shadow, while the sides of Braich-ddu slope gradually
to the lake&rsquo;s margin.&nbsp; The Franc&ocirc;n mountains, in
the distance, are astonishingly grand, and altogether this lake
scene may be considered the finest in Caernarvonshire.</p>
<p>A gentleman in the winter of 1831, was driving along the road
which skirts the borders of the lake, when upwards of a thousand
tons of rock fell from the heights of Benclog, a little below the
falls into Nant Franc&ocirc;n, a short time after he had passed
them, and he beheld one portion roll into the valley and river,
while the other rested upon the road he had just travelled,
rendering it impossible for any carriage to proceed by that
route, until the obstruction was removed.</p>
<p><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>A
mile distant from Llyn Ogwen is another lake, well worthy of
being visited, which lies in a deep hollow of the Glyder
mountains called</p>
<h3>LLYN IDWAL,</h3>
<p>where the gloomy horror of the scenery is most appalling;
particularly the terrific chasm of <i>Twll Ddu</i>, or the Black
Cleft.&nbsp; This spot derived its name from the following crime,
which was perpetrated here.</p>
<p>Prince Owain Gwynedd, who reigned in the twelfth century, had
a favourite called <i>Nefydd Hardd</i>, to whose care he
intrusted his son <i>Idwal</i>, and who betraying his trust,
commanded his son <i>Dunawt</i> to destroy the young prince, a
crime which he too faithfully obeyed, perpetrating the cruel deed
at this place.&nbsp; But, being discovered, Nefydd, and his
posterity, were degraded from the rank of nobles to bondsmen, and
Rhun, the son of Dunawt, who again became possessed of the
property of his ancestors, granted the ground upon which the
church of Llanrwst now stands, as an expiatory gift for the foul
crime imputed to his father.&nbsp; The grave of Idwal is still
pointed out by the inhabitants, close to the lake.</p>
<p>The scenery around is well calculated to inspire <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>fear in the
timid, as being adapted to the committal of atrocity of any
kind.&nbsp; Bleak, black, desolate and stern, it thrills the
beholder with an indescribable sensation of terror.</p>
<p>The lake is well stored with fish, of a darker colour than
those in the Ogwen, and of a less delicate flavour.&nbsp; These
lakes are in the parish of Llan Tegai, so called from its patron
saint <i>Tegai</i>, the son of <i>Ithol Hael</i>, a nobleman of
Amorica, brother to Credifael and Flewin, who built Penmynydd and
Llanflewin, in Anglesea, about the year 636.&nbsp; <i>See
Roland&rsquo;s Mona Antiqua Rest</i>. <i>p.</i> 189.</p>
<p>After a delightful day&rsquo;s ramble amongst this wild and
sublime scenery, I returned to the inn at Capel Curig, and on the
following morning took the road to Llanrwst, which in a short
time becomes particularly interesting.&nbsp; The dark and
comfortless sterility is exchanged for a delightful valley, with
luxuriant woods, which stretch to the summit of the hills upon
either side; and near the two mile stone is one of the most
picturesque cottages imaginable, placed on the side of a hill
above the bridge, which crosses the river Llugwy, and gives
additional beauty to the romantic dell.&nbsp; Half a mile beyond
is an observatory, which stands upon the highest point <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>of a
towering cliff, a portion of whose summit is clothed with purple
heath, and the remainder presents a face of grey barren rock,
while beneath a forest of rich foliage creeps from its base far
up the craggy sides.</p>
<p>Within a mile of this place are the celebrated waterfalls,
called</p>
<h3>RHAIADR Y WENNOL,</h3>
<p>i.e. the Spout of the Swallow&mdash;a cataract of about sixty
feet in width.&nbsp; The river, at the top of the first fall,
flows in an unbroken sheet, but soon becomes dispersed in various
streams that dash and struggle through the impending masses of
rock, charming the ear with their complicated roar.&nbsp; At the
second fall, it rushes in a collected volume into the boiling
vortex, from whence, at the third, it is dispersed in
spray.&nbsp; A small wicket gate by the road side, leads to a
footpath through the grounds, to the falls, where the visitor
cannot fail to find an adequate reward for his digression.&nbsp;
The old oak trees that overhang the ravine are beautifully
grouped.&nbsp; On one side, a large rock rises perpendicularly
nearly 500 feet, and the earth is clothed with velvet moss and
decked with wild flowers.&nbsp; Fancy <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>would picture just such a retreat,
for a wandering sylph! while the rays of light, darting through
the greenwoods, remind us of the flittings of Sir John
Wynne&rsquo;s ghost, which was said to haunt this glen for many
years, but is now laid at rest in the depths of the lower
fall.&nbsp; Journeying onward, I reached the village of</p>
<h3>BETTWS Y COED,</h3>
<p>which being translated is the Station in the Wood; and a most
delightful station it is.&nbsp; The Shrewsbury and Holyhead road
run through it, and the junction of the Llugwy and the Conway
rivers is at no great distance.&nbsp; The church is a venerable
structure, and contains an old monument, erected to the memory of
Griffith, the son of David G&ocirc;ch, who was a natural son of
David, the brother of Llywellyn, the last Prince of Wales.&nbsp;
He died in the fourteenth century, and a stone statue of him is
in a recess on the north side of the church, with this
inscription: &ldquo;Hic jacet Gruffydd ap Davyd G&ocirc;ch, agnus
Dei misere mei.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At about a mile from Bettws is an iron bridge of one arch,
which carries the Holyhead road over the river Conway.&nbsp; Its
span is 105 feet, <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>and it is called the Waterloo Bridge, from its having
been erected in the year that tremendous battle was fought.&nbsp;
But the principal object is,</p>
<h3>PONT-Y-PAIR,</h3>
<p>the Bridge of the Caldron.&nbsp; It has four arches, and the
natural rock supplies it with piers, that seem to defy the
efforts of time or the fury of the waters.&nbsp; Immediately
above the bridge is the fall and salmon leap.&nbsp; The river
rolls and plunges into a deep reservoir below.&nbsp; The grandeur
of the scene during the floods, I was informed, surpasses
imagination, and, unfortunately for me, the heat of the sun had
dried them up, when I visited this celebrated spot.</p>
<p>For this bridge the inhabitants are indebted to one Howell, a
mason, who resided at Penllyn in the year 1468; and, having
occasion to attend the assizes at Conway, he was unexpectedly
prevented from passing the Lleder by the fury of the flood.&nbsp;
That a similar disappointment might not occur to others, he
erected a wooden bridge across that river, and trusted to the
generosity of travellers to remunerate him.&nbsp; The success of
this attempt encouraged him to erect the bridge <a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>at Bettws y
Coed, which is now called Pont y Pair, but he died before it was
completed.</p>
<p>Upon the right of this bridge is Carrey y Gwalch, or the Rock
of the Falcon, well clothed with trees, through which the bald
cliffs peep, like a body of sharp shooters from a brush wood,
anxious to escape detection.&nbsp; In this rock is a recess
called the cave of Shenkin, a celebrated outlaw, who found
shelter here from the unremitting efforts of justice during the
reign of Edward IV.</p>
<p>The entrance to this spot is blocked up by a large piece of
rock, and the following legend is seriously related by the old
women of the neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>OGO AP SHENKIN.</h3>
<p>In the reign of our seventh Henry, when the civil wars which
desolated the hearths of rich and poor, ceased to afflict the
nation, and peace and plenty once more spread their smiling
influence throughout the land, there lived near this village a
man, called Jordan ap Jordan, a wood-cutter and goatherd, whose
time was occupied between watching his goats upon the <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>mountains,
and felling trees in the forest.&nbsp; He was a short square
built man, with a squint eye and a blue nose.&nbsp; He was
thought to be half distracted between the desires of a miser, and
the vices of a drunkard; for, whenever one passion predominated,
he raved like a bedlamite at the other, and he who shunned him in
the morning for his sordid qualities would fairly take to his
heels at full speed, to avoid him in the evening when he was in
his cups.</p>
<p>Jordan was, therefore, generally shunned by his neighbours,
and would often repair to the bridge of the Caldron, to meditate
upon future wealth, or to roar out his bacchanalian stanzas to
his unwearied companion the waterfall.&nbsp; He was fond of a
thundering accompaniment, and here he was gratified to his
heart&rsquo;s fondest wish.&nbsp; The superstitious peasantry
were often alarmed, as they passed the bridge after twilight, to
their several homes, to hear his unearthly raving mingled with
the sound of the cataracts, and to see his ungainly form perched
upon the parapet of the bridge, which they often mistook for an
evil spirit.&nbsp; One morning, before daybreak, as he was
gradually recovering from his evening&rsquo;s excess, the
grasping fiend of avarice seized upon his heart, as was often the
case, when he reflected <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>on his extravagance on the foregoing
night; and, after venting many bitter curses upon all earthly
spirits (alias drams) prayed most devoutly to all spirits,
celestial, for a plentiful accession of worldly pelf, to add to
his store, which he had concealed in the hollow of a certain
tree; when &ldquo;a still small voice,&rdquo; which even the roar
of the torrent permitted him to hear, whispered to him that Ogo
ap Shenkin might contain &ldquo;something worth seeking
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This cave, as I have before mentioned, was the retreat of the
celebrated Shenkin; and, although the bold outlaw had long ceased
to commit his depredations, the place of his resort was held in
dread by the superstitious peasantry, who firmly believed that
his spirit was to be seen every night, prowling about the gap, to
terrify and torment all poor souls who ventured to wander near
this haunted ground.</p>
<p>The woodman pricked up his ears at the sound of the voice,
and, after turning the thing over and over again in his mind, and
weighing the pros and cons in the scale of his bewildered
judgment, he determined to venture on the experiment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;though ghosts walk by
night, I never heard of their venturing out by day;&rdquo; and
hastening home he replenished his <a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>bottle, which he thought it prudent
to take with him in case of frights and sights, which an
application to it might enable him to endure with fortitude.</p>
<p>It was yet grey morning, and the mist still lay in the valley,
as Jordan ap Jordan advanced his <i>blue light</i> in the
direction of Shenkin&rsquo;s cave; one eye peering in the
direction of the hollow, and the other traversing the craggy
mountain tops and down the hills&rsquo; sides, like a vagrant
scout watching the enemy&rsquo;s motions or looking out for
squalls.</p>
<p>The heavy fog was now fast rising on the mountain&rsquo;s
side, obscuring the mouth of the cave so completely that Jordan
was very often compelled to apply his mouth to the flask, in
order to rectify the effects of the unwholesome dew, which he
inhaled by gallons.</p>
<p>Thicker and thicker came on the fog, and lighter and lighter
became the flask; until what with one thing, and the other, he
scarce knew whether his track lay to the right, or to the left;
and, but for the consolation of the spirit, he would infallibly
have been <i>routed by terror</i>; but as it was, he only
acknowledged to being <i>overcome with liquor</i>, and his
reluctance to confess so much was only conquered on finding
himself <a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>stretched half way into the cave, without the power of
resuming his standing position.&nbsp; While he lay thus sprawling
and unable to rise, gazing with &ldquo;lack lustre eye&rdquo;
into the gloomy recess, he fancied he beheld some lights
flickering at a distance, dancing up and down, and running to and
fro!&nbsp; His hair stood on end with fright, his eyes almost
started from his head with curiosity, and the liquor evaporating,
as his terror became stronger, he miraculously recovered the use
of his legs, which he instantly endeavoured to make use of in
escaping from the cavern.&nbsp; But, to his utter consternation,
he discovered that the entrance was closed up, and an appalling
noise of a long drawn, ba-a-a-a-a! made him look once more in the
direction of the lights.</p>
<p>He now fancied he saw only two, but they grew larger and
larger, till they resembled two moons.&nbsp; And presently he
heard a buzzing sound, as if a thousand bees were about his ears;
and on a sudden the cave became lighted up with a thousand
torches, for it seemed to have expanded to an incredible
magnitude; and, in the centre, upon a huge oaken chest well bound
with iron clasps, stood a goat of prodigious size, with a beard
which seemed to be of <a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>ten times the magnitude commonly
given by artists to Aaron the high priest.&nbsp; Full, shaggy,
and venerable did it appear.&nbsp; His horns, like mighty
corkscrews, issued from his forehead, terminating in two
portentous points; and his eyes,&mdash;for they were his eyes,
which Jordan&rsquo;s disconcerted vision had mistaken for
moons&mdash;were fixed upon a clasped book, the leaves of which
he was deliberately turning over with his right fore hoof, as if
he cared no more for Jordan ap Jordan&rsquo;s proximity, than if
he had been one of his own species.</p>
<p>The woodman being by this time perfectly sober, felt his
desire of wealth grow stronger than fear; and he could not help
thinking that the oaken chest contained the treasure he so much
coveted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfectly right,&rdquo; said the goat,
answering to the thought of Jordan, without taking his eyes off
the book he was perusing; &ldquo;and you shall see the
treasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then touching a spring with his fore paw,
the side of the chest flew open, and Jordan saw more gold than he
ever thought the world contained, and every piece stamped with
the king&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Jordan, with his natural impulse,
rushed forward to grasp some of the shining coin! but, the goat
<a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>presented his horns to him, saying, &ldquo;If you touch
any of this coin before it is properly prepared, instant death
will be your fate,&rdquo; and then, with a loud ba-a-a-a-a, he
summoned a number of grave elders about him, to whom he gave
suitable directions, and these presently kindled some dry wood
upon a slab of rock, and put an iron pot with a spout to it over
the flames, while Jordan wondered to see them use their cloven
feet so cleverly in adjusting matters as occasion required.&nbsp;
These preparations being completed, they took from the chest
large bags full of gold, and emptied them into the iron pot, one
after the other, until it was completely full; and then commenced
dancing round it on their hinder legs, ba-a-a-a-ing most
inharmoniously.&nbsp; This ceremony continued some time, when lo!
the coin being fusible, melted, and became a burning liquid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the monster goat to Jordan-ap-Jordan,
&ldquo;I will make thee a man of gold!&nbsp; Thou dost thirst for
gold and shalt have more than thou desirest.&nbsp; Swallow thou
this pot of boiling metal, and fear not.&nbsp; The heat will have
no effect upon thee&mdash;so drink&mdash;drink and be
wealthy!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>Jordan looked upon the molten gold as it sparkled and
became agitated in the vessel, and, stooping to take a closer
inspection, was surprised to find it destitute of heat, though
still retaining its liquidity!&nbsp; Having ascertained this
fact, he made no hesitation in obeying the goat&rsquo;s commands,
and took huge draughts of the precious fluid, which, like warm
jelly, flowed smoothly and agreeably into his capacious
maw.&nbsp; No sooner had he drained the measure, than the
venerable goat leaped from the chest, and presenting his terrific
horns, cried, &ldquo;Now Jordan, fly for your life;&rdquo; at the
same time, making a charge upon his rear, which completely
ejected him from the cavern at full speed.&nbsp; No sooner had he
passed the cavern&rsquo;s mouth, than he tumbled with violence to
the ground; and at the same moment a huge mass of rock fell from
the summit of the hill, and effectually blocked up the entrance
of Ogo ap Shenkin.</p>
<p>It was mid-day when Jordan quitted the cave, and the sun shone
in all its brilliant beauty.&nbsp; Filled with wealth and wonder,
he hastened towards his cottage, calculating all the way the
prodigious extent of his riches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must take care of myself now,&rdquo; said Jordan, <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>&ldquo;for,
if by any chance, my secret should be discovered, I shall share
the fate of the goose that laid the golden eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reflection made him uneasy; and as he was frequently
hailed, in sport or ridicule, by the shepherd lads from the
mountains, he quickened his speed to avoid observation.</p>
<p>For ten years after this, Jordan was never seen except at
night, and then it was only for a moment and upon the
bridge.&nbsp; He was like a phantom there&mdash;and gone in an
instant.&nbsp; No one saw him in his former occupation; his
cottage was deserted, and he lived, no one knew where.</p>
<p>The gradual decay of his wardrobe was noticed, as at various
times he was recognised by those to whom he was formerly known;
until, at length, he was entirely destitute of every article of
clothing; and a village curate was, one bleak and wintry night,
roused from his bed, by the moaning of some human creature,
apparently at the threshold of his door.&nbsp; He let him in,
pale, emaciated, naked, and ghost like.&nbsp; He placed him,
shivering, on his bed; and the dying creature glared wildly about
the apartment, as he exclaimed in terror,</p>
<p><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>&ldquo;Take care they don&rsquo;t steal me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; inquired the good curate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world&mdash;all the world, are looking for
me,&rdquo; replied the wretch; &ldquo;but I shall escape them
yet.&nbsp; You are a good man; you would not rob the dead, would
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, you fear Heaven&mdash;you fear its curses here,
and its vengeance hereafter.&nbsp; I think I may trust you, as I
have not above an hour to live.&nbsp; Look at me! don&rsquo;t you
see what they hunt me for?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all gold!&mdash;a man
of gold!&mdash;robbers seek for me, to buy them
food!&mdash;Spendthrifts hunt after me, to pay their
debts!&mdash;Women grasp at me, to purchase jewels!&mdash;And
kings lay snares for me, to gorge and fatten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then related his wonderful adventure in Ogo ap Shenkin;
and, as he concluded it, exclaimed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bury me safely.&nbsp; You make take my little finger,
that will pay all expenses, but don&rsquo;t break up my
body&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo; and the
hypochondriac expired. <a name="citation304"></a><a
href="#footnote304" class="citation">[304]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is no doubt that the vision of the goat <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>and the
chest of wealth, was a dream after one of Jordan&rsquo;s drunken
bouts, which produced so powerful an impression upon his mind,
that it banished the few wits intoxication had left him.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">GRAY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I stood taking a farewell look of this beautiful village,
with my knapsack on my back, and fishing rod in my hand, I was
suddenly roused from my reverie, by a slap on the shoulder, and,
on turning my head, I perceived an old woman, who held out to me
some half dozen, much soiled, silver tea spoons, addressing me at
the same time in Welsh: she might as well <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>have spoken
to me in the language of the ancient Chaldees.&nbsp; However, I
took the spoons in my hands, and, after turning them over and
over for some time, and endeavouring to elicit her meaning
without success, I shook my head as gravely as my Lord Burleigh
is made to do, in Sheridan&rsquo;s entertainment of the Critic,
and returned them to their venerable owner.&nbsp; Disappointment
made the wrinkles of her aged forehead deeper than usual, and I
was turning to resume my journey, when a flash of intelligence
crossed her smoke-dried visage, and, making a sign for me to
stop, she ran into her cottage, and presently returned, her face
glowing like a hot coal, with an old umbrella in her hand, which
she displayed fantastically in every way she thought likely to
attract my notice, making use of sundry pantomimic gestures, none
of which could I understand; and I began to think myself in
company with some unhappy creature escaped from Bedlam.&nbsp; I
again attempted to proceed with more earnestness than before,
when, to my astonishment, a pair of grey, much worn,
inexpressibles were held up to my eyes, while the gesticulations
of the old woman became stronger and stronger, and I at length
discovered, that I had been mistaken for <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>a
travelling pedlar by the old beldam, who wished to exchange the
articles she produced for something with which she imagined my
knapsack was furnished!</p>
<p>Within half a mile from the town of Llanrwst is</p>
<h3>GWYDIR CASTLE,</h3>
<p>the property of Lord Willoughby d&rsquo;Eresby, a family
mansion of no very attractive appearance.&nbsp; It is situated on
the right of the road, which winds between it and a lofty
wood-clad precipice, called Carreg-y-Gwalch, or the Rock of the
Falcon.&nbsp; It was built by John Wynne ab Meredydd, in 1555,
and has lately undergone some alteration.&nbsp; The breakfast
parlour contains a curious carving of the arms of the Gwydir
family, supported by Julius C&aelig;sar and Augustus; the former
holding his commentaries in one hand, and his sword in the other;
the latter, his sword only.&nbsp; The dining-room has some
specimens of carving, that are worthy of observation; but
throughout the mansion there is very little of what belonged to
it originally.&nbsp; The chairs, panelling, and even tables,
being coloured for the purpose of giving <a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>the
apartments the appearance of antique splendour, which, until
lately, they wanted.</p>
<p>The drawing-room is spacious and lofty, and is lighted by a
double row of windows, which gives it a heavy look: this unusual
arrangement was caused by the removal of the dormitory, to give
height to this room.&nbsp; Over the fire place is a finely
executed carving of Julius C&aelig;sar in oak.&nbsp; At the N.W.
end of the room, a piece of tapestry represents a vintage, and at
the S.E. another specimen of needlework commemorates the landing
of Charles V at Grenada.</p>
<p>The coronation chair of George II is shewn in this apartment,
and the footstool used by Queen Caroline on her trial at
Westminster Hall.&nbsp; There is a centre table, very richly
ornamented with carved work; and another, which in shape exactly
resembles the slab and pedestal of a tombstone, so that the
visitor, naturally enough walks up to it, expecting to see the
customary, &ldquo;Hic jacet&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>The cradle of Sir Richard Wynne, bearing the date 1634,
completes the list of curiosities contained in this room.</p>
<p>The garden, which is extensive, contains some valuable plants
and shrubs, and the terrace is a pleasant promenade, sloping from
which are <a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>beds of exceedingly beautiful flowers, of various
classes and descriptions.&nbsp; After satisfying the housekeeper
with a trifling gratuity, I proceeded to Llanrwst, but halted
upon the bridge to take a view of the Conway (over which
beautiful river its arches expand), and the town to which it
leads.&nbsp; I was here accosted by an old man, who asked me,
&ldquo;if I should like to feel the bridge shake?&rdquo;&nbsp; As
I answered in the affirmative, he desired me to place my back
against the side over the centre arch, and striking the opposite
parapet rather heavily with his own, a tremulous motion was
distinctly felt; on this account, it is called the Shaking
Bridge.&nbsp; It was built in 1636, from a plan of the celebrated
Inigo Jones, and cost &pound;1000, which was defrayed by the
counties of Denbighshire and Caenarvonshire, which it unites.</p>
<h3>LLANRWST</h3>
<p>is built upon the Denbighshire side of the river.&nbsp; The
Three Eagles is the most commodious inn in the town; and, being
rather fatigued, I threw my limbs upon a sofa, and resigned
myself to the drowsy god, first taking especial care to order a
substantial repast to be in readiness for <a
name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>me on my
return from the land of Nod.&nbsp; My last waking recollection
was the words of Mr. Lover&rsquo;s favourite song,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use at all in my going to
bed,<br />
For it&rsquo;s dhrames and not sleep, that comes into my
head.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dreams, however, did not picture my slumbers, and I awoke to
the unrivalled delight of a weary and hungry traveller&mdash;an
excellent hot dinner.&nbsp; While the waiter cleared the table,
and put on the desert, I took a glance from the windows at the
market-place and town-hall; against the latter were pasted sundry
bills, some of which bore, I thought, a strong resemblance to the
dramatic announcements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bills are those?&rdquo; said I to the waiter, as
he placed my pint of port before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play bills, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, have you a theatre here?&rdquo; said I, opening
my eyes with astonishment.</p>
<p>The man stared, appeared confused and stammered, and,
supposing me shocked at the immoral announcement, proceeded to
assure me, that although the players were tolerated, they had
very little patronage, &ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; continued he,
&ldquo;such vagabonds do a great deal of <a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>harm to
business; we feel it, sir.&nbsp; Now to-night there is a bespeak,
which will do us a serious injury, for we have no less than six
visitors who are going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bespeak, eh! and who bespoke the play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, &rsquo;tis Mr. &mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. &mdash;!&rdquo; I exclaimed, with a sort of
inquiring glance, which occasioned the waiter to look more
ridiculous than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean Mr. &mdash;, of Belmont?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, that&rsquo;s the gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had I received this information, than filling my
glass, &ldquo;His honored health!&rdquo; I cried, adding the
words of the bard,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May never-fading laurels flourish round
him,<br />
And consecrate his name ev&rsquo;n to Time&rsquo;s
end!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a bill of the play,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; The
man withdrew with much apparent reluctance, but shortly returned
with one, which, snatching from his hand, I began eagerly to
peruse, until perceiving the increasing wonderment which
stupified the eyes of the waiter, I followed up the foregoing
quotation with another, <a name="page313"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>which I addressed to him in seeming
wrath.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced
loon!<br />
Where got&rsquo;st thou that goose look?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which had the desired effect, and relieved me from his
presence.</p>
<p>A month had passed away since I had visited a temple dedicated
to Thalia or Melpomene, and, with all the enthusiasm such
divinities inspire, I hastened to arrange my dress in the best
manner possible, to pay them my devoirs.</p>
<p>The play was announced to begin at half past seven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The time had nearly arrived, and fully
anticipating much gratification I reached the Town Hall.&nbsp; A
staircase, not of the cleanest, led to the theatre on the first
floor, and passing some hanging of green-baize, which formed a
narrow passage to the pit and gallery, I was ushered into the
former, which being set apart for the <i>gentry</i>, consisted of
about six forms, such as are used in schools, and ranged behind
each other.&nbsp; A barrier of the most unostentatious fabric
stretched across the room from wall to wall, behind which were
about the same number of forms, arranged in like manner, this
back portion <a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>being denominated the gallery.&nbsp; As I entered, I
perceived a fine portly gentleman, seated in a large elbow chair
at the extremity of the first form, whose countenance was lighted
up by half a dozen candles, that flared magnificently within
three feet of the front row, and divided the stage from the
audience.&nbsp; &ldquo;There needed no ghost&rdquo; to tell me
that this was the gentleman who had honored the theatre by his
patronage on that occasion, and to whom I was the bearer of a
letter of introduction, then in my pocket-book.&nbsp; The
proscenium was of painted canvass, and a green curtain of the
same material scantily screened the mysteries which were
preparing on the stage.&nbsp; Upon the right of the room, a
temporary box contained the band.&nbsp; Those who have heard the
burst of melodious sounds thunder forth from the orchestra of the
opera, which startles the uninitiated, in an overture of
Mozart&rsquo;s, or in the wild and stormy grandeur which
characterizes the compositions of Weber, may have some idea of
the overpowering effect produced by a violin, played by a boy
about twelve years of age, who was leader of the band, consisting
of one old man of sixty, who rasped fearfully on a violincello,
and an enthusiastic trombone player, who successfully drowned the
unskilful efforts <a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>of the other two with the tremendous roar of his
elongating distracter.&nbsp; The front of the house was
illuminated by three tallow candles, one on each side, stuck in
tin candlesticks and nailed against the wall, and one at the
extremity of the room.&nbsp; The first piece to be acted was the
<i>Mid&rsquo; night Hour</i>; after which, I thought it high time
to retire.</p>
<p>The following morning I employed in paying my respects to the
different gentlemen to whom I had letters, and in gaining what
information I could respecting the objects most worthy of notice
in the town, and surrounding neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The church and chapel adjoining, were the first subjects to
engage my attention.&nbsp; In the former there is nothing
interesting, excepting an oaken screen, exquisitely carved, which
was taken from the Abbey of Maenan, the gallery for the singers
being above it.&nbsp; On the opposite side is the</p>
<h3>GWYDIR CHAPEL.</h3>
<p>This beautiful structure was erected in the year 1633, by Sir
Richard Wynne, of Gwydir, from a design of Inigo Jones, and was
for many <a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>years the burial place of the illustrious family of
Gwydir.&nbsp; At the sides of the chapel, fixed in panels of
wood, are several engravings on brass, illustrative of the
personages who are interred below; and in the east corner is a
tablet of white marble, containing the following remarkable
pedigree, comprising a period of 500 years.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This chapel was erected <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1633, by Sir Richard Wynne of
Gwydir, in the county of Carnaervon, Knight and Baronet,
Treasurer to the High and Mighty Princess Henrietta Maria, Queen
of England, Daughter of Henry the Fourth, King of France, and
Wife to our Sovereign Lord King Charles; where lyeth buried his
father Sir John Wynne, of Gwydir, Knight and Baronet, son and
heir to Morris Wynne, son and heir to John Wynne, son and heir to
Meredith Wynne, which three lie buried in the Church of
Dolwyddelen, with tombs over them.&nbsp; This Meredith was son
and heir to Evan, son and heir to Robert, son and heir to
Meredith, son and heir to Howell, son and heir to David, son and
heir to Griffith, son and heir to Cradock, son and heir to
Roderick, Lord of Anglesea, son to Owen Gwynedd, Prince of <a
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>Wales, and
younger brother to David, Prince of Wales, who married Emma
Plantaginet, sister to King Henry the Second.&nbsp; There
succeeded this David three princes; His nephew Leolinus Magnus,
who married Joan daughter to King John,&mdash;David his son,
nephew to King Henry the Third,&mdash;and Llewelyn the last
Prince of Wales of that House and line, who lived in King Edward
the First&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Sir John Wynne married Sydney, who
lyeth buried here, daughter of Sir William Gerrard, Knight, Lord
Chancellor of Ireland, by whom he had issue, Sir John Wynne, who
died at Lucca, in Italy, Sir Richard Wynne now living, Thomas
Wynne who lyeth here, Owen Wynne now living, Robert Wynne who
lyeth here, Roger Wynne who lyeth here, William Wynne now living,
Maurice Wynne now living, Ellis Wynne who lyeth buried at
Whitford, in the county of Flint, Henry Wynne now living, Roger
Wynne who lyeth here, and two daughters, Mary now living, married
to Sir Roger Mostyn, in the county of Flint, Knight, and
Elizabeth now living, married to Sir John Bodville, in the County
of Carnaervon, Knight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beneath this is a superb engraving of Dame <a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>Sarah
Wynne, one of the daughters of the old Chevalier Sir Thomas
Middleton of Chirk Castle, and wife of the above mentioned Sir
Richard Wynne; she died June 16th, 1671.&nbsp; This piece of
engraving was executed by one William Vaughan, in a style of
elegance hardly to be met with, and may be justly reckoned among
the first productions of the age in which he lived.</p>
<p>On the south side are two stately pyramidical columns of
variegated marble, decorated with martial insignias; one to the
memory of Meredith Wynne, the other to Sir John Wynne and Sydney
his wife; on their pedestals are Latin inscriptions on black
marble, which have been thus translated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the Memory of Meredith Wynne, a
descendant of Owen Gwynedd, Prince of Wales, who, under happy
auspices, founded the House of Gwydir, removed and endowed the
Church of Sant Gwyddelen, during the third tournean expedition,
in the fifth year of Henry the Eighth.&nbsp; He died in the month
of March 1525.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Memory of John Wynne of Gwydir, Knight and
Baronet, with Sydney the daughter of William Gerrard, Knight,
Chancellor of the Kingdom of Ireland, the wife of his youth, to
<a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>whom she
bore eleven sons, and two daughters; they lie here waiting the
appearance of Christ in Glory.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the above Monuments is a small Tablet of white marble
to the Memory of John Wynne ap Meredith, with a Latin inscription
to the following effect:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;John Wynne ap
Meredith, an Inheritor of his<br />
Father&rsquo;s virtues, a just and pious Man, to<br />
whom Euna his wife brought five sons<br />
and two daughters.&nbsp; He died the<br />
9th of July 1559.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the floor is a stone effigy in armour, with the feet
resting on a lion couchant, of Howell Coetmore ap Griffith Vychan
ap Dafydd Gam, alias G&ocirc;ch, natural son to David, Prince of
Wales, from whose descendants, according to tradition, Gwydir was
purchased by the Wynnes.</p>

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Near to the effigy of Howell Coetmore is the underpart of a
stone coffin in which Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, surnamed the Great,
the son-in-law of King John, was buried at the Abbey of Conwy; to
the coffin is fixed a piece of brass with this inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a

is the coffin of Leolinus Magnus, Prince<br />
of Wales, who was buried at the Abbey of<br />
Conwy, which upon the dissolution<br />
was removed thence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On going from the chapel to the church, you pass over a large
square flag of free stone, having on its sides a Latin
inscription thus translated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the Memory of the Sons of John Wynne of
Gwydir, Knight and Baronet, who died during their father&rsquo;s
life time: John Knight, was buried at Lucca, in the free State of
Italy, in the year of his age 30, of our Lord 1613.&nbsp; Robert,
who had entered into holy orders, in the year of his age 24, of
our Lord 1617.&nbsp; Thomas, Roger, Thomas, in their
minority.&mdash;Death! a vapour!&nbsp; Behold! we have
existed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the chancel, between the reading desk and the communion
table, is a flag of freestone on the remains of Margaret Vaughan,
heiress of Caergai; she was esteemed the Sappho of her age; many
of her poetical productions are still extant.</p>
<p>The gallery over the reading desk is said to <a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>have been
removed here from the Abbey of Aberllechog or Maenan Abbey, upon
the dissolution of that religious house.</p>
<p>Under the reading desk in the Church, in a pew belonging to
Kyffdy, is a Latin epitaph to the memory of Griffith Lloyd, of
Bryniog, Rector of this parish; this is said to have been written
by himself, and has been much admired for its
singularity:&mdash;it runs thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Once
the undeserving School-master,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the more
undeserving Lecturer,<br />
And last of all, the most undeserving Rector of this Parish.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not think, speak, or write any thing evil of the
Dead.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a Market Hall, Town Hall, free schools and alms
houses.&nbsp; The latter were erected by Sir John Wynne, in 1610,
and received the name of Jesus Hospital.&nbsp; He endowed them
for the reception of twelve poor men, by ceding the rectorial
tithes of Eglwys Fach, which are valued at &pound;200 per
annum.&nbsp; Within a mile of Llanrwst there is a spring, which
is much esteemed for its healthful qualities.&nbsp; The water is
soft, and a drop of sal-volatile mixed with a cup of it, turns it
white as milk, while oil of tartar causes it to assume a pearl
colour.&nbsp; If during the tourist&rsquo;s visit to Llanrwst
there <a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>should chance to fall much rain, I would advise him by
all means to view the cataract called</p>
<h3>RHAIADR-Y-PARC MAWR,</h3>
<p>in the valley of Nant Bwlch yr Haiarn, near Gwydir, but
otherwise the minuteness of the stream occasions no extraordinary
effect from this fall, which is about one hundred feet in
height.&nbsp; The chief object of interest, however, in this
vicinity, is the celebrated lakes, called</p>
<h3>LLYN GEIRIONYDD,</h3>
<p>upon the borders of which once lived the chief of the Welsh
bards, <i>Taliesin</i>.&nbsp; At the eastern side of the lake is
a mound, upon the summit of which there is a kind of hollow, and
in it are the remains of an ancient edifice, which was probably
the residence of Taliesin, in the reign of Maelgwn Gwynedd, king
of Britain.&nbsp; Taliesin when an infant was found by Prince
Elphin by the side of a wear belonging to his father Gwyddno
Garanhir, lord of Cantrev Gwaelod.&nbsp; The prince fostered the
infant, and had it liberally educated; and, at a proper age,
introduced him to the court of his father Gwyddno.&nbsp; Upon
this occasion, Taliesin presented the king with a poem, <a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>the subject
of which was his own history, and another to the prince, which he
called Dyhuddiant Elphin, or the consolation of Elphin, a
translation of which is in Evan&rsquo;s specimens of Welsh
poetry.</p>
<p>Taliesin had an opportunity of being serviceable to his
benefactor; for once, when the prince was imprisoned by his uncle
Maelgwn, in the castle of Tejanwy, the magic of his muse effected
his release.</p>
<p>This celebrated bard was the preceptor of Myrddin ap Merfryn,
and to him the lovers of poetry are indebted for five new metres,
while the historian and antiquary are equally benefitted by his
accurate description of the manners and customs of the ancient
Britons.</p>
<p>I quitted Llanrwst on the following morning, and took the road
to Conway: two miles and a half brought me to the pretty village
of</p>
<h3>TREFRIW,</h3>
<p>which presents an animated scene.&nbsp; It is situated upon
the banks of the beautiful river Conway, which is navigable up to
this point for vessels of fifty tons burthen, that supply the
town and neighbourhood with coals, lime, groceries, <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>&amp;c.
&amp;c. and return laden with slate, supplied from the adjacent
mines and quarries.</p>
<p>A number of small boats, called coracles, used by the
fishermen, are seen studding the delightful stream, while the
larger vessels, towed against the wind or sailing before it,
present a pleasing picture.</p>
<p>From this place to Conway there is nothing particularly to
attract attention, until you arrive within a mile of that
celebrated town, when from the brow of a hill, is obtained a view
of the venerable fortress erected by the first Edward, and the
strongly fortified walls, completely encompassing the town, and
strengthened by massive towers.&nbsp; They are coeval with the
castle, and are built in the form of a Welsh harp, like those of
Caernarvon; but here there are no environs, and the town presents
the same appearance as when the chivalric monarch first fortified
it.</p>
<h3>CONWAY.</h3>
<p>The town derives its name from Cyn (chief) and Wy (river).</p>
<p>The principal inn is the Castle, which affords every
accommodation the traveller can desire.&nbsp; <a
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>The Wynnes
are celebrated here, as in all parts of North Wales.&nbsp; In the
interior of the town stands <i>Plas Mawr</i>, which was erected
in 1585, and is still a remarkable structure; its founder was
Robert Wynne of Gwydir, the uncle of Sir John Wynne the
historian.&nbsp; Over the grand entrance is inscribed, in Greek
characters, &ldquo;<i>bear and forbear</i>,&rdquo; over which in
Roman characters, &ldquo;J. H. S. X. P. S.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Jesus
Hominum Salvator et populi salus).&nbsp; The old college is in
Castle Street, and the church is built from the remains of the
ancient Cistercian Abbey, which was founded here by Llewellyn ap
Jorwerth, 1185.&nbsp; It contains a rich baptismal font of gothic
structure, with a tablet to the memory of Nicholas Hookes of the
town of Conway, who was the forty-first child of William and
Alice Hookes, and who was himself the father of twenty-seven
children.</p>

</a></p>
<p>During my short stay in Conway, I endeavoured to discover the
best view of the town, which I think is from the eastern side of
the river, about midway between the chain bridge and the mansion
of Sir John Hilton.&nbsp; Nothing can be more interesting.&nbsp;
The variety of small craft, sailing and anchored, before its
warlike screen; the castle, with its towers and turrets, <a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>rising in
hostile grandeur upon its rocky base; the bridge, and lovely
scenery beyond of purple hills and thriving villages; and the
bright waters sporting with the luxuriant foliage of its woody
margin, create a sensation of delight in the pursuer of
picturesque scenery, which he has probably seldom before
experienced.</p>
<p>Another delightful view may be obtained by ascending the rock,
which overhangs the lodge of the bridge upon its eastern
side.&nbsp; A flight of steps conducts to the summit, where a
seat is most conveniently placed for the accommodation of the
lovers of romantic beauty; and the bridge, although inferior in
magnitude to the stupendous work of art which stretches over
Bangor Ferry, commands the admiration of the spectator.&nbsp; But
the chief object of interest is the castle, which surpasses in
picturesque grandeur any building of the kind I ever
beheld.&nbsp; I thought Carnaervon Castle the most beautiful of
ruins, but it is not, in my opinion, to be compared with
Conway.&nbsp; The solidity of its structure, and its expansive
site, resembling the fortresses of Syria and the Holy Land, give
to its exterior all that the most romantic imagination could
desire.&nbsp; Its foundation is a rock of slate, and its works
are impregnable.&nbsp; Nothing <a name="page327"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 327</span>but famine could, at the time it was
erected, have had power to subdue it.&nbsp; Its walls are from
ten to twelve feet in thickness, and it had formerly a deep and
broad moat, on the west and north west sides; which with the sea
washing its base on the east and south, formed insurmountable
barriers to the assailants.</p>
<p>It was evening when I first entered this noble ruin.&nbsp; The
porteress very ungraciously left me to my meditations after
admitting me, locking the gate after her, and leaving me like a
state prisoner in the royal fortress.&nbsp; I confess I was
little pleased with the manners of my conductress and the
solitary situation in which I was placed, and sensations arose
within me like those which a school boy feels when passing a
churchyard at midnight.</p>
<p>The sun had set, and the deep shadows of eve were darkening
into night, as I stood alone in the court yard, and flitting
visions arose before me of those who crossed its space in distant
bygone ages&mdash;&ldquo;the plumed troops,&rdquo; and courtly
dames, and all the glitter of the olden times.&nbsp; As I thus
stood amongst the ruins, a deep drawn sigh, close by my ear, made
my heart leap into my throat, as I turned to discover from whence
it proceeded.&nbsp; But all was solitude <a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>around.&nbsp; The huge festoons of ivy, unruffled by a
breath of air, hung heavily in funereal grandeur on the
walls.&nbsp; As I passed into what had been the banqueting hall,
the darkness increased.&nbsp; It was a noble apartment, and
measured 130 feet in length, and thirty in breadth, in height
twenty.&nbsp; Nine windows looked southward, up the river, and
two into the courtyard.&nbsp; In the recesses were stone seats,
capable of accommodating twelve persons; and, as I seated myself
in one of these, my delusion of other days came over me.&nbsp;
Here sat the first Edward, the hero of Palestine; here was the
monarch besieged, and almost reduced by famine; here Hotspur and
King Richard held a conference; and the latter, putting himself
into the power of Northumberland, was betrayed by him, and sent a
prisoner to the usurper Bolingbroke.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Life&rsquo;s but a walking shadow&mdash;a
poor player,<br />
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br />
And then is heard no more!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I made this apt quotation, another deep and heavy sigh, and
a rustling in the ivy, startled me, and the bird of solitude, the
lonely owl, flapped his heavy wings, and flew past me to a <a
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>remoter
corner of the ruined hall.&nbsp; I arose, and walked to a small
chamber, where there was an open ornamented casement, and which,
as I was afterwards informed, bears the name of the queen&rsquo;s
oriel; from which there is a pleasant prospect of part of the
ruin and scenery beyond.</p>
<p>I then proceeded to the terrace, at the south western
extremity, which is on the surface of the rock; and the prospect
from this spot, interesting at all times, is doubly so by
moonlight.&nbsp; The suspension bridge beneath, the ocean on the
left, and this fertile valley on the right, with the sparkling
Conway meandering through it, compose a scene of unexampled
beauty.</p>
<p>In the year 1290, when Edward was engaged in a dispute with
the King of France, and was determined to revenge himself upon
that potentate, in order to obtain supplies, he made the
experiment of taxing his newly acquired Welsh subjects; which
they resented by hanging Roger de Pulesdon, who had been
appointed to collect the tax; and by defeating the English
forces, who attempted to enforce them.</p>
<p>Alarmed at a revolt, which was now rising into importance, and
which threatened to wrest from him his new dominions, Edward
entered North Wales, to conduct the war in person.</p>
<p><a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>Having proceeded in his march to Conway, he crossed
that arm of the sea with a part of his forces, and retiring into
the castle with them, awaited the arrival of the remainder.&nbsp;
In his passage he lost many waggons, and other carriages, loaded
with provisions, which were intercepted by the Welsh, who came
down in multitudes from the mountains, and invested the castle,
upon the land side, while a sudden rise in the Conway, which
prevented his troops from crossing the river and rendering him
assistance, made his situation extremely alarming.&nbsp; He was
surrounded by water and the enemy, cut off from his army, and
threatened with famine.</p>
<p>The good fortune of Edward, however, returned to him in the
hour of need.&nbsp; The river subsided, and his forces being able
to cross to his relief, the Welsh again retired to the mountains,
and the English monarch passed his Christmas holidays without
interruption at the castle.</p>
<p>In 1665, the Earl of Conway, under pretence of its being for
his majesty&rsquo;s service, stripped the castle of all its
furniture, iron and lead, and shipped them off to Ireland,
otherwise it might have remained as firm and entire at the
present day, as when it was first erected.</p>
<p><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>If
these Goths were aware of the ignominy they attached to their
shields by acts so disgraceful, they might perhaps have permitted
beauty and grandeur to remain undefiled by their sacrilegious
touch.</p>
<p>The young men still keep up many of the ancient local customs;
amongst which, on Nos Calanmai, or, the eve of the first of May,
they hang on the houses of their sweethearts bunches of rosemary
and ribbons.</p>
<p>At the door of a prude they tie a penglog, or part of a
horse&rsquo;s skeleton.&nbsp; There is likewise a custom
preserved called Stocsio.&nbsp; Upon Easter Sunday, a great
number of boys and men assemble on Pentwthil, with wands of
gorse, to proclaim the laws and regulations which are to be
observed upon the following morning.&nbsp; The last married
person is sought to perform this office, who, mounted on a heap
of stones, issues his mandate, while the rest listen with silent
attention.&nbsp; He decrees that all men under sixty years of age
are to appear in the street before six o&rsquo;clock on the
following morning; and all under forty, before four; and all
under twenty are commanded not to go to bed at all, under penalty
of being put into the stocks.</p>
<p><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>The
orator then descends, amidst loud cheering, and the assembled
parties separate; the younger branches to form plans of
amusement, and the graver to secure their carts, waggons, and
wheelbarrows, with chains and locks, to prevent their being
seized upon the following day; a very necessary precaution, as
every vehicle, unmanacled, or otherwise unsecured, is sure of
being pressed before dawn of day into the service of the
light-hearted youths, who are not over careful of their
neighbour&rsquo;s property during the uproarious period of their
festivity.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the stocks are placed at one end of the
street, and a party, marching to the inspiring music of a drum
and fife, parade the town, in order to convey to the place of
punishment all seceders from this ancient law of custom.&nbsp;
When they arrive at a house where a rebel resides, the storming
party endeavour by all practicable means to gain admittance; such
as climbing in at the windows, forcing open the back door,
&amp;c., and they generally secure the culprit; who, if he be
caught in bed, is allowed sufficient time to dress himself, and
then hurried away to the stocks, amid the exulting shouts of the
assembled multitude.</p>
<p><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>His
feet being secured, one of the party gives him a severe lecture
upon the sin of idleness, and of breaking old established
customs.&nbsp; Then taking his right hand, he puts questions to
him; such as, whether he would rather kiss the mistress or the
maid?&mdash;whether he prefers buttermilk or strong
ale?&mdash;and the more satisfactory his answers are to the
party, the more thickly his hand is plaistered with mud, until at
length he is released, and, with loud cheering, permitted to join
the forces, as they march off in search of another rebel.</p>
<p>There is a pearl fishery at Conway, and many poor families are
supported by gathering the muscles, which contain these gems.</p>
<p>The fish is called by Linn&aelig;us <i>myd
margaritefera</i>.&nbsp; The produce is transmitted to London in
the pure natural state, and easily finds a market amongst the
jewellers, who purchase them by weight, but in the neighbourhood
of Conway the purposes they are appropriated to are unknown.</p>
<p>It was my good fortune to meet with a brother tourist at the
Castle Inn; who, after acquainting me with the above facts,
offered to conduct me in the morning to Llandudno, which <a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>offer I
thankfully accepted; and, before the sun had finished his draught
of mountain dew, we had crossed the bridge, and were pursuing our
course to the appointed spot.&nbsp; The tide was at low ebb, and
a pleasant walk of three quarters of a mile upon the hard sand
brought us to</p>
<h3>DINAS GONWY</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The fort of the Conway.&rdquo;&nbsp; By the English, it
is called the Gannoc and by the common people in the
neighbourhood &ldquo;Y Faer dre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ruins of an ancient castle are to be seen at a short
distance, situated upon two hillocks, near the shore.&nbsp; From
thence we crossed by Eglwy&rsquo;s Rh&ocirc;s, where Maelgwn
Gwynedd is said to have taken refuge to avoid the yellow fever,
which was committing great havoc in all parts of Europe.&nbsp;
Gloddaeth, the residence of Lady Mostyn Champneys, is sweetly
situated near this place.&nbsp; It was built by her ancestors in
the reign of Elizabeth, and is celebrated for the Welsh
manuscripts contained in the library.&nbsp; The grounds are most
tastefully laid out, and the tourist will find himself amply
rewarded for <a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>his pains while viewing the extreme beauty of the
scenes around.</p>
<h3>LLANDUDNO</h3>
<p>is built upon a huge mass of rock which projects into the sea,
called The Great Orme&rsquo;s Head; a small village, where
formerly a great deal of smuggling was carried on; and, as we
stood gazing upon the frightful precipice beneath us, at the base
of which the ocean breaks its mighty bulk, and foams as if
enraged at opposition, my companion related a story of a
fisherman&rsquo;s daughter and her lover, the circumstances of
which took place within view of the position we then
occupied.</p>
<h3>THE SMUGGLER.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It was my fortune, or rather my misfortune,&rdquo; said
my companion, &ldquo;some forty years ago, to take up my quarters
at a fisherman&rsquo;s hut in the village, who was a widower with
one child, a lovely girl of about sixteen years of age.&nbsp; She
performed all the household duties for her father with the
greatest neatness and cheerfulness, and <a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>at evening
was looked upon by the youth of the surrounding neighbourhood, as
the gayest and handsomest lass that tripped upon the hard sands
to the music of a blind harper, who lived in the vicinity.&nbsp;
Many a time as I stood and saw her light feet moving in the
inspiring dance, have I said to myself, it would be a pity now if
so light a foot should ever carry a heavy heart.&nbsp; Poor Jane!
she was the sweetest wild flower of the cliff&mdash;nursed in
storm and tempest, yet in her simplicity more winning to the
heart and eye than the proudest exotic luxury could
produce.&nbsp; I took a pleasing interest in her; and for the
attention she paid me, resolved upon improving her education to
the extent of my ability, which I considered an easy task, for
the organ of veneration, I observed, was large, which induced me
to think she respected those who took an interest in her
welfare.&nbsp; Benevolence and hope were equally prominent, and,
when this happy association appears, the leading feature of such
persons&rsquo; characters may be perceived in the religious
obedience they pay to all those who are anxious to instruct their
minds and purify their thoughts.&nbsp; I felt notwithstanding,
considerable anxiety for her future welfare; for at the lower
part and back of the head, between the <i>mastoid processes</i>
<a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>and the
<i>occipital bone</i>, I had noticed an enlargement, which I
knew, combined as it was with the moral sentiments and the organs
of adhesiveness, strongly developed, would either prove the
blessing or the bane of her existence, as these opposites
depended not only upon the man&rsquo;s disposition to whom she
might yield her affections, but to the destiny of that man,
successful or disastrous.&nbsp; And I had frequent opportunities
of observing that she had a strong partiality for a youth who was
possessed of personal and mental qualifications far beyond those
of his associates, but who was wild, with the bump of
marvellousness extremely prominent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you cover your story
with so many excrescences, I shall never be able to remember one
half of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My companion smiled benevolently, as he replied, I perceive
you lack the organ of <i>individuality</i>; and then resumed the
thread of his discourse.&nbsp; After remaining with them nearly
three months, during which I may give myself credit for having
made good use of my time in improving the manners and intellect
of my docile pupil, I took leave of the fisherman and his
daughter, promising to pay them a visit in the course of a month,
before I returned to <a name="page338"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 338</span>merry England.&nbsp; Tears stood in
the eyes of poor Jane as I turned to quit the cottage, and the
old father squeezed my hand with a cordiality that effectually
stopped the circulation of my blood in that extremity.&nbsp;
Mark, her lover, seemed neither sorry nor pleased, but leaning
his broad back against the white-washed wall of the cottage,
whistled with the greatest composure, &ldquo;The jovial
fellow&rsquo;s farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a month&rsquo;s ramble, I returned to this spot on a
dark, stormy day in October;&mdash;it was indeed a dreary
evening.&nbsp; The rain fell in torrents, and the hoarse sound of
the surge came heavily upon my ear as I approached the cottage of
my late worthy host; when suddenly, as I lifted my eyes from the
ground, I perceived a number of persons walking in slow
procession, as from a funeral, and a cold shudder came over me as
I recognised the father of Jane; his white locks exposed to the
beating rain, his head bent to the ground, and his hands clasped
upon his breast, in the action of mental agony.</p>
<p>Thinking my visit would prove ill-timed, I proceeded to a
small public-house, and, while my garments were drying at the
fire, I managed to extract from the landlord, that the funeral of
Jane Morgan had just taken place.&nbsp; Astonishment <a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>and sorrow
chained my tongue for some time; I shall never forget the
sensations I experienced at this mournful relation.&nbsp; I sat
motionless in my chair, without uttering a syllable for a full
hour, or noticing anything that transpired around me during that
time.&nbsp; I could think of nothing but Jane Morgan; I could see
nothing but her young blooming face and yellow locks, which used
to glitter like threads of gold in the sunbeams, as the fresh sea
breeze blew them into a thousand fantastic waves; her airy form,
as it flew along the sand on which her light foot scarcely left a
print; her simple dress; all this I brought to my
&ldquo;mind&rsquo;s eye,&rdquo; and afterwards the church-yard
where she was laid a corpse&mdash;I burst into tears.</p>
<p>Her lover, Mark Bratts, who had for more than a twelvemonth
paid courtship to poor Jane, had obtained her father&rsquo;s
consent to their union, whenever he could realize a sufficient
sum to begin the world with in a prudent and respectable
way.&nbsp; The precarious life of a fisherman, however, appeared
to Mark to hold out but little prospect of wealth enough either
to gain or to support a wife; and he resolved upon obtaining the
object of his wishes as speedily as possible in some other
way.</p>
<p><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>A man
named Simpson, a notorious smuggler in the neighbourhood, was
known to have amassed a considerable property, and Mark resolved
to offer himself to serve as one of the crew on board his lugger;
hoping, that in a trip or two, he might earn sufficient to claim
his promised bride.&nbsp; He was accepted aboard; and the day
following the little vessel spread her light sails to the breeze,
and took her course for Holland.&nbsp; Mark possessed a little
money which he laid out in a venture, trusting thereby to clear
so much as would enable him to claim as his bride the object of
his love.</p>
<p>It was a stormy day when the inhabitants of Llandudno were
roused by the report of guns from seaward, the wind blowing
furiously right on shore.&nbsp; It was about the time that the
smuggler&rsquo;s vessel was expected, and those interested in her
safe arrival hastily ran to this promontory to ascertain if she
was in sight, or in danger, for a king&rsquo;s cutter was known
to be cruising on the coast.&nbsp; It was just dawn; the sea was
running mountains high; and within a league of the rocks they
perceived two vessels within half a mile of each other.&nbsp; The
first was a small lugger, carrying a press of canvass that seemed
to run her hull under as she made directly for <a
name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>the
headland, and her masts bent like reeds to the fury of the
tempest.&nbsp; As she approached the headland, a number of kegs
piled one upon another on the decks, were observed to vanish into
the deep by dozens, being flung overboard by the busy crew.&nbsp;
They were within a mile of the shore, when the revenue cutter,
hauling her wind, poured a broadside of grape shot into the
smuggler, so well directed that several were seen to fall from
their stations in various parts of the vessel.&nbsp; Still they
carried every stitch of canvass, knowing that there was water
enough for the light lugger to cross the bar after they had
rounded the point, and that the revenue cutter would be sure to
strike upon the sands if she attempted to follow them half a mile
further, being of much heavier tonnage.&nbsp; Besides, she was
already in some peril, by venturing so far in shore, with a gale
blowing heavily from the north east.</p>
<p>She was soon within hail of the head, and the cliffs were
covered with human beings, gazing eagerly upon the little craft
beneath it, when suddenly, a chain shot from the cutter carried
away her mainmast, which fell over the side.&nbsp; To cut away
the stays and clear the wreck, was the work of a minute, and the
smuggler&rsquo;s bark <a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>swept like a sea bird round the
great Ormes head into the Bay of Conway, but not until their
pursuers had sent another broadside into her hull as they stood
off shore.&nbsp; As the Typhon, the name of the king&rsquo;s
vessel turned from the pursuit; the daring outlaws sent up a
shout of triumph, which was echoed from those upon the rocks, and
after a slight shock which the lugger received, as she crossed
the sand-bank, they floated safely in smooth water.</p>
<p>But where was Jane?&nbsp; Foremost of that crowd which
gathered on the rocks, when the firing was first heard, flew the
light form of the loving maiden, like a young eagle glaring for
its mate.&nbsp; She stood upon the extreme verge of the cliff,
unconscious of every thing, save the peril of her lover, her eyes
fixed upon the vessels, straining as they would crack their
strings, to discover the form of him who had her heart in
keeping; and, as the vessel glided under the headland, she hung
over the brink of the precipice, gazing upon the dead and dying,
with whom the decks were strewed.&nbsp; But she saw him
not.&nbsp; With the swiftness of the seamew, she followed the
course of the smuggler along the shore; and when at last she saw
the white sails gathered to the yards, and the vessel riding
safely at anchor in the <a name="page343"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>rocky bay, she leaped into a boat,
and rowed herself to its side.&nbsp; A moment, and she jumped
upon the deck, calling wildly for poor Mark.&nbsp; But no one
answered her.&nbsp; With hair dishevelled, and eyes glancing
fire, she turned each dead man&rsquo;s face up to the sky.&nbsp;
At length, a headless trunk met her distracted gaze.&nbsp; A
bright gold ringlet of hair, tinged with the smuggler&rsquo;s
blood, and fastened to the breast of his shirt, the blue
pea-jacket she gave Mark at his departure, and the brass buckles
which her father wore, and presented to him as a pledge of future
favour, all flashed conviction on her mind, that it was the
mutilated form of her lover.&nbsp; A wild scream, which struck
terror into the hearts of the daring crew, proclaimed her heart
was broken; and falling on his mangled corse she instantly
expired.</p>
<p>This was the melancholy end of the lovers.&nbsp; And you may
remember that I said her happiness or misery would depend not
only on the disposition of the man she loved, but upon his future
destiny; the organs of amativeness and adhesiveness being so
largely developed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Here an object attracted his attention at a short distance,
and he suddenly left off speaking <a name="page344"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>to examine the scull of a melancholy
donkey, which stood gazing upon the waste of waters.</p>
<p>Having carefully examined the animal&rsquo;s pericranium, on
which he made some scientific remarks, elaborately pointing out
the distinguishing characteristics of the quadruped and biped
race, I reminded him that it was high time to retrace our steps
to Conway, and, as we trudged along, he related a story of rather
a whimsical nature, which, as it tended to illustrate his
favorite science, afforded me much amusement.</p>
<h3>THE BUMP OF ORDER.</h3>
<p>He lived, he said, at one time opposite to a house where
resided a newly married couple.&nbsp; The house had the
appearance of particular neatness, the flag stones before the
door being white as snow, as were those supporting the railing of
the area.&nbsp; The ledges of the windows were in keeping with
the rest, and the windows themselves were perfectly
unstained.&nbsp; The curtains below were of green damask, and
above of elegant chintz, with pink linings.&nbsp; A variety of
plants bloomed in the balcony, and the pots were ranged in
precise order.</p>
<p><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>It
greatly excited his curiosity, that every week, for upwards of a
twelvemonth, he saw one or two new servants.&nbsp; It appeared
that one week was the longest period the lady ever permitted any
menial to remain in the house.</p>
<p>This circumstance created some surprise, as, during the time,
he had never observed a single gentleman or lady knock at their
door.</p>
<p>He had an opera glass, through which he took every opportunity
of examining their heads across the street.&nbsp; At length, his
bump of curiosity over-mastering every other consideration,
determined him to seek an occasion of becoming acquainted with
the lady of the house.&nbsp; For this purpose, he dressed himself
with peculiar nicety, and stepping over, intimated by a
rat-tat-tat that he was at the door.&nbsp; A female servant
answered the summons, and ushered him into the parlour, where the
lady was seated gazing with a vacant stare upon some pots of
geraniums, which occupied a niche in the apartment.&nbsp; When a
lady receives a visit from a gentleman she has never been
introduced to, it is natural for her to look in his face, and an
opinion is too frequently formed by the Lavater-loving sex, of
the character, at first sight, of the being before them.&nbsp;
But Mrs. &mdash; took a very different view of my <a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>philosophical friend; for her eyes fell from the
geraniums to the toes of her visitor, as if she had the art of
discovering the character of a man by the state of his boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will excuse the appearance of a stranger
at&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>The lady interrupted him with, &ldquo;None of the cleanest,
indeed, Mr. Thingumbob.&nbsp; Good God, Susan, why did&rsquo;nt
you tell him to wipe his feet on the mat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg you will excuse,&rdquo;&mdash;continued my
friend, apologizing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I must excuse.&nbsp; My gracious! what
are you doing, sir? you&rsquo;ve put your nasty wet hat upon my
beautiful rose-wood table!&nbsp; Why, Susan, I say, bring a
cloth&mdash;who could ever believe that any man would bring his
hat into a parlour! you stupid girl, is that the way to rub a
table? use a little elbow grease, you intolerable slow
coach&mdash;there, get away and let me do it myself!&rdquo; and
with that the lady snatched the cloth from the hands of her
domestic, and began rubbing and puffing in a style which
sufficiently proved she was capable of <i>giving</i>, if not
<i>receiving</i> a polish.</p>
<p>After ten minutes&rsquo; exercise, the lady returned the
rubber to the servant, and with a face ruddy <a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>as the full
moon at its rising, seated herself upon the chair, and cast a
look of satisfaction round the room at the peculiar neatness of
its appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perceive, madam,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;you
take particular delight in seeing your apartments kept clean and
neat, and the arrangement of this room does honour to your
taste;&rdquo; he had touched the string that vibrated to her
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess, sir, I feel a pride in seeing every thing in
its place, and cleanliness is an indispensable qualification in
the servant I engage.&nbsp; Will you believe me, sir, when I tell
you that this girl you just saw, is the forty-ninth I have had in
the last twelvemonth, and I have no more idea of keeping her than
I have of taking back any of her predecessors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah madam, servants are sad plagues!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plagues, sir, they are devils.&nbsp; Why, it was but
yesterday, when I thought my house, from the attic to the
kitchen, was so clean, that not a speck of dirt could be visible
to a fly, I was obliged to upset a whole boiler full of the most
delicious pea-soup into the middle of the kitchen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phrenologist lifted up his legs, by instinct, <a
name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>as if he
felt the sprinkling of it upon them, and exclaimed, &ldquo;How
unfortunate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunate, sir, it was insupportable,&rdquo; cried
the lady; &ldquo;but I made her clean it up again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My learned friend was then put to a nonplus; he could not for
the life of him, make out why Mrs. &mdash; should have taken the
trouble to upset a boiler of pea-soup into the middle of the
clean kitchen; and this he politely requested her to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll tell you, sir, it is my pleasure to see
every thing in its place, and a grease spot to me is as bad as a
plague spot to many.&nbsp; Now, sir, although the kitchen looked
better, I&rsquo;ll be bound to say, than any other kitchen in
town, yet I was anxious to see if my servant had obeyed my orders
in taking a spot of grease out of the boards, which by accident
fell upon them the day before; so lifting up the
oil-cloth&mdash;judge of my horror and dismay to find it
untouched!&nbsp; I inquired the reason.&nbsp; The servants had
the impudence to tell me, they had not time, at which, I made no
more ado, but threw the boiler of soup upon it, which took them a
good two hours to clean up again.&nbsp; I <i>will</i> have every
thing done, and in order.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>&ldquo;Indeed, madam,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;I
perceive the admirable effects of your system&mdash;this room is
in admirable order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This room, sir! have the goodness to walk into my
bed-room up stairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My phrenological friend, although he had passed the meridian
of life, could not help thinking this invitation rather
extraordinary, more particularly so, when the lady desired him to
take off his shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I never allow even my
husband to come up stairs in his shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it so happened that my friend had a particular reason for
wishing to avoid this ceremony, having walked a hole in one of
his stockings the day before, and the laundress was in possession
of his <i>other</i> pair.&nbsp; Nothing, however, could alter her
determination of exhibiting her cleanliness.&nbsp; She protested
he should see her bed-room, and insisted on his taking off his
shoes!</p>
<p>With a shrug <i>&agrave; la fran&ccedil;aise</i>, he
submitted, but had not ascended half way up the stair-case before
the lady who followed, perceived the injury his hose had
sustained, and with a cry of horror exclaimed, &ldquo;Susan!
bring up a needle and thread!&rdquo; the words were scarcely
uttered, <a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>when the girl appeared, and without hesitation (without
asking him to draw off his hose) seizing him by the foot,
compelled him to submit to her needle&rsquo;s operation; blushing
and confounded at the awkward position his unjustifiable
curiosity had drawn him into; having completed her orders, the
girl descended to the kitchen, while he ascended to a square
landing place on the first floor.&nbsp; On the outside of the
window was a veranda filled with the choicest plants and flowers;
the casement being open a delightful breeze entered the house,
bringing with it the odours of the little garden; and he was
about making a complimentary observation upon the admirable
arrangement of her bough-pots, when, helter-skelter, in, through
the casement, bolted a large tabby cat, and with a spring,
clearing my friend&rsquo;s shoulders, alighted upon the elegantly
laced cap of the precise Mrs. &mdash;.&nbsp; They had not time to
recover from their first alarm, when down tumbled all the roses,
lignum vit&aelig;s, rhododandrums, geraniums and myrtles, being
dislodged by a huge tom-cat rushing in, in pursuit of the
aforesaid timid feline intruder.&nbsp; Crash, crash! went the
bough-pots&mdash;squall, squall, went the lady.&nbsp; Damnation!
exclaimed the gentleman.&nbsp; The lady&rsquo;s foot slipped, and
she slid <a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
351</span>and bumped to the bottom of the stairs; the
phrenologist, endeavouring to save her, blundered completely over
the lady.&nbsp; The two cats scampered round and athwart the
elegantly arranged parlour, dislodging every ornament from the
chimney-piece; and at length, my friend, having recovered his
shoes, hastily snatched up his hat and cane, and made a
precipitate escape from the house of a lady, who was unfortunate
in having the bump of <i>order</i> too strongly developed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We arrived at the castle in Conway greatly fatigued, and
equally delighted with our day&rsquo;s ramble.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">SIR WALTER SCOTT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning, we
started for Aber.&nbsp; The coast scenery is extremely grand; <a
name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 353</span>and
passing, the promontory of Penmaen Bach, a semicircular range of
mountains, stretching to the overpeering height of Penmaen Mawr,
from a delightful shelter to one of the most beautiful coast
retreats in North Wales.</p>
<p>The present road winds round the waist of Penmaen Mawr, and
nothing can exceed the terrors that, above and underneath it,
meet the eye of the traveller.&nbsp; A few goats are generally
seen wandering among the shingly surface; and their motions,
though so light, send the loose fragments down, like the fall of
a glacier.&nbsp; As I stood gazing on the awful depth beneath,
four large pieces of rock rolled into the centre of the road, not
ten yards from the place where I was standing, the smallest of
which, had it touched me, would have caused instant death, or
disabled me in such a manner as to have prevented my venturing
upon a second tour.&nbsp; I turned my eyes above, and thought
upon the legend of Dolbadarn; and my blood chilled to think, if,
by any chance, a steed and rider should be precipitated over its
brow&mdash;what a spectacle they would exhibit at its base!&nbsp;
But, at the time of the legend, there was scarce footing for a
goat to pass along, and nothing to interrupt the parties from
finally plunging into the sea.</p>
<p><a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>&ldquo;When last I visited this spot,&rdquo; said my
companion, &ldquo;I observed a man sitting by the road side, with
his hands clasped, his elbows resting upon his knees, and his
face bespeaking feelings of deep sorrow.&nbsp; I have a strong
aversion to intruding on the secrets of others; but this lorn
man, seated in such a solitary situation, and forming so
interesting a foreground in the picture, made me desirous of
entering into conversation with him, in order to discover the
source of his grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You seem to be in grief, my friend; can I do
anything to relieve it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;God bless you, sir, you cannot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May be otherwise, if you will tell me the
cause.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, sir; but it is out of your
power to repair my loss.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He then feelingly related the following simple
tale.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE PET GOAT.</h3>
<p>About three years ago, sir, I married one of the prettiest
girls you ever saw&mdash;an inhabitant of the neighbouring
village.&nbsp; Her good heart was light, and her hand always open
to the <a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>stranger and the poor, as far as our means could
afford.&nbsp; We were married in the little church of Aber, and a
merry one was our wedding day.&nbsp; Her mother gave me a young
kid upon the occasion, which we took home with us and brought up
in the cottage, as you would a dog that you loved for the
giver&rsquo;s sake; and for its own sake I loved the pretty
animal.&nbsp; It was as playful and as gentle as a kitten; and I
taught it a number of tricks that greatly amused all our
neighbours.&nbsp; Truan hyny!&nbsp; At length, my poor Mary
brought me a boy, but she, poor girl, was too delicate to suckle
the infant, and my gentle goat, that had lately brought forth two
kids, supplied us with milk for the child, who did well, and God
be praised, still does well;&mdash;my poor pet was the saving of
his life.&nbsp; Well, I went to my work, as usual, and Mary made
my home a heaven upon earth;&mdash;for she was an angel, and
furnished me with every comfort that mortal could desire.&nbsp;
God bless her!&mdash;and she is blessed, if goodness finds bliss
in heaven, which no one doubts.</p>
<p>Well, sir, a second year flew away quickly, and my partner
brought me forth twins&mdash;the sweetest babes eyes ever looked
upon, and so like each other, you couldn&rsquo;t tell which was
<a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>which;
so we tied a ribbon upon Mary&rsquo;s arm, to distinguish her
from Kate.&nbsp; Well, my poor pet goat again stood wet nurse to
the offspring; and my wife recovered her health and beautiful
looks; our evenings passed in talking of what we should do for
them, when they grew up.&nbsp; Ah, sir, it would have done your
heart good to have seen her blue eyes turned up to the sky,
imploring blessings upon their innocent heads, and every night
kneel down to pray to her Creator, for mercy on herself and me!
although He knows better than I do, that she was as free from
soil as the waters of the rocky rill, and you might see her heart
as clearly as the pebbles at its bottom.&nbsp; Ah! that was a
sight for good men to look upon, and be thankful that they had
seen it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir; but I can&rsquo;t
help shedding tears, when I think upon the fate of poor
Mary!&mdash;gwae! gwae!</p>
<p>The pet goat, sir, was wandering upon the shelving rocks which
now hang over us, and there were many others above.&nbsp; Do you
see that, sir, with one of its horns nearly straight, just upon
the edge of that projecting mass?&nbsp; Just beneath that she was
browsing, when, all of a sudden, a large piece fell from the brow
of the mountain, and, lighting upon the body of my <a
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>favourite,
she was dashed into the centre of the road, just where we are now
standing; and, when I ran to her the look of her bright grey eyes
went to my heart&mdash;poor thing!&nbsp; I never saw anything
more affectionate in a christian; for her looks spoke more than
any words I ever heard in the way of gratitude; and she licked my
hand, poor dumb beast! and sighed, and died without a groan, poor
thing! poor thing! (and he wept in the bitterness of his
feeling.)</p>
<p>You may wonder, sir, that I should cry so, when I tell you
about the death of a goat; but it is the consequences attendant
upon it that wring the tears from my eyes.&nbsp; When poor pet
died, my wife was obliged to nurse her young twins, for no woman
could be found in the neighbourhood to assist her, and I
couldn&rsquo;t afford to buy another goat, and I couldn&rsquo;t
bear to ask for milk which I wasn&rsquo;t able to pay for, for
all somehow went wrong with me after the loss of our
favourite.&nbsp; Mary grew weaker and weaker every day, and I
couldn&rsquo;t go to my work, and leave her, without any one to
watch over her.&nbsp; My spirit was broken, and I cared for
nothing in the world, but attending the sick bed of Mary and the
children.&nbsp; To be sure, I managed to get enough for the
support of life; but <a name="page358"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 358</span>the twins couldn&rsquo;t eat the
food I brought them.&nbsp; The mother had not milk enough to
support them; and I saw her, day by day, sinking under the
affliction I had no power to soften.&nbsp; At length, my two
pretty babes died, one after the other, and Mary&rsquo;s heart
broke to see the stroke of Providence.&nbsp; She died too, sir,
and with her all that made life dear to me, except my poor little
boy.&nbsp; I shall never, never recover! and I know that the sod
will shortly be laid upon my head, by the side of the grave where
rest the bones of my dear Mary.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The numerous accidents that have happened on this mountain
render it an object of awful interest.&nbsp; Mr. Pennant, in his
tour, relates the following circumstances:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Rev. Mr. Jones, who in 1762 was the
Rector of Llanelian in the Isle of Anglesea, fell, with his horse
and a midwife behind him, down the steepest part.&nbsp; The
<i>sage-femme</i> perished, as did the nag.&nbsp; The divine,
however, with great philosophy, unsaddled the steed, and marched
off with the trappings, exulting at his preservation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He relates another accident, that occurred here, in the
following words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have often heard of another accident, <a
name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>attended
with such romantic circumstances, that I would not venture to
mention it, had I not the strongest traditional authority to this
day, in the mouth of every one in the parish of Llanfair Fechan,
in which this promontory stands.&nbsp; Sion Humphreys, of this
parish, paid his addresses to Ann Thomas, of Creuddyn, on the
other side of the Conway river.&nbsp; They had made an
appointment to meet at a fair in the town of Conway.&nbsp; He in
his way fell over Penmaen Mawr.&nbsp; She was overset in the
ferry boat, and was the only person saved out of fourscore!&nbsp;
They were married, and lived very long together in the parish of
Llanfair.&nbsp; She was buried April 11th, 1744, aged 116.&nbsp;
He survived her five years, and was buried Dec. 1749, close by
her in the parish church yard, where their graves are familiarly
shown to this day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the summit of a hill, in the neighbourhood of Penmaen Mawr,
are the ruins of an ancient British camp, of vast magnitude,
which was deemed impregnable.&nbsp; It is a site of considerable
interest, as well for its antiquity, as for the magnificent
prospect which it commands of the ocean, the Isle of Anglesea,
the straits, the Ormes head, the island of Priestholm, the
beautiful <a name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
360</span>town of Beaumauris, and the chain of Snowdonia, of
which it is the terminating link.</p>
<p>Having passed round the frightful promontory of Penmaen Mawr,
by the admirable road which, with incredible labour, has been cut
by government, at the expense of &pound;10,000, and forms a belt
to the mountain, the country becomes more fertile; the
plantations are larger, and more numerous, and the hills are
clothed with verdure, which never appears upon the wild forehead
of that frowning mass; and hedges rise on either side of the
road, through which the eye is pleased with the sight of waving
fields of grain, until we reach the picturesque village of</p>
<h3>ABER.</h3>
<p>The name of the inn here is the Bulkley Arms, and a more
comfortable hostel, for one who travels in search of the beauties
of nature, cannot be desired; although, to the fastidious, it
may, perhaps, be thought too small, and to the luxurious it may
not offer the viands which he covets.&nbsp; For myself, give me
the room overlooking the beautiful little garden which sends its
thousand perfumes into the apartment, when the sun goes down and
the <a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>moon
lights up the Menai with her silver beams!&nbsp; Let me sit,
silent and alone, there&mdash;there, where &ldquo;heavenly
pensive contemplation dwells.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the entrance to the
glen, upon its eastern side, is a very high artificial mound,
flat at the top, which is said to be the site of a castle
belonging to Llewellyn the great.&nbsp; On it stands the house of
Mr. Crawley, a sketch of which, with the glen, is annexed.&nbsp;
It was taken from under the arch of the bridge, and gives a
better idea of the scene than words have power to convey.</p>
<p>The mountain, on the eastern side of the vale is clothed with
oak and ash trees; but, upon the west, there is no foliage.&nbsp;
The river rushes with great impetuosity after a flood, from its
mountain fall, into the Menai straits, winding through the glen,
and encircling several rocky islets in its course.&nbsp; The fall
is about a mile and a half up the stream, and, at the extremity
of the vale, a convex mountain rises, down which it leaps, from a
height of about sixty feet; and there is said to be a large stone
here, on which the army of Llewellyn sharpened their spears and
arrows; and the marks are still shown to the tourist.</p>
<p>But the prospect from the bridge, which crosses the stream, on
the road to Conway, is <a name="page362"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 362</span>the most interesting; from this spot
you command a view of the river, at its greatest magnitude,
sparkling along its rock-impeded course, and behold it dancing
and foaming, as if with joy, into the salts, like a child
bounding to its mother.</p>

<p>The following short poem is founded upon a tradition connected
with this place.&nbsp; It was twilight when the muse flew in at
the window, and at that endearing time I yielded to her
influence.&nbsp; The story is well known to every villager of
this delightful neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>LLEWELYN AND THE CAPTIVE KNIGHT.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Oh! who is he that rides along<br />
So proudly on his charger strong,<br />
Amid yon gay and gallant throng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through Aber&rsquo;s lonely vale?</p>
<p>With plumed casque upon his head,<br />
And mace at saddle bow so red,<br />
And battle brand, the foeman&rsquo;s dread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And glittering shirt of mail?</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis ancient Cambria&rsquo;s pride and boast,<br />
Her hope, her strength, her chief, her host,<br />
Whose fame she spreads from coast to coast.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And trumpets to the sky!</p>
<p><a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>And
Saxon blood is on his mace,<br />
And gouts his shining blade deface,<br />
Hail, bravest of the bravest race!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pride of chivalry!</p>
<p>And who is she, so peerless fair,<br />
With full dark eye, of lustre rare,<br />
And snowy neck, and raven hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On palfrey by his side?</p>
<p>With native gems upon her vest,<br />
Snowdonia&rsquo;s own&mdash;Snowdonia&rsquo;s best,<br />
Rising and sinking on her breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And glance of royal pride?</p>
<p>The noblest lady of the land,<br />
(For she with him joined hand to hand<br />
In wedlock&rsquo;s stout and holy band),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Llewelyn&rsquo;s noble dame.</p>
<p>For her do bards their praises sing,<br />
And minstrels strike the sounding string,<br />
Till mountains high and valleys ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With fair Johanna&rsquo;s name!</p>
<p>And who is he with drooping plume,<br />
And golden locks, and brow of gloom,<br />
Whose cheek hath lost its manly bloom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sorrow speaking eye?</p>
<p>William de Breos is he hight,<br />
A courtier fair and gallant knight,<br />
Ta&rsquo;en by Llewelyn in the fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Montgomery.</p>
<p><a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 364</span>Oh!
&rsquo;tis a glorious sight to see<br />
The marshalled ranks of liberty,<br />
With banners waving high and free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind down the hollow vale;</p>
<p>Their broad swords flashing in the sun,<br />
And spears too bright to look upon,<br />
Returning from the field they&rsquo;ve won,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from the foeman pale.</p>
<p>The prince within his castle wall,<br />
There rose a shout from one and all,<br />
That shook the mountain&rsquo;s rocky hall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And made the welkin ring.</p>
<p>And gaily passed the wassail bowl,<br />
While bards poured out the song of soul,<br />
And martial music crowned the whole,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Time moved on pleasure&rsquo;s wing.</p>
<p>But pleasure&rsquo;s wing may sometimes lose<br />
Its plumage bright, of varied hues,<br />
And time grow dark with sorrow&rsquo;s dews,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cloak itself in care.</p>
<p>And eyes that wanton love inspire,<br />
And blaze with light of fierce desire<br />
Be quenched in floods of anguish dire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wither in despair!</p>
<p>Months rolled away, and while in war,<br />
Llewelyn shone the leading star,<br />
The knight and dame, in pleasure&rsquo;s car,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolled rapidly along.</p>
<p><a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>Guilt
smiled upon their couch of down,<br />
But o&rsquo;er them was an angel&rsquo;s frown,<br />
Till their adult&rsquo;ry, bolder grown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Became a ribald song.</p>
<p>Llewelyn to his home returned,<br />
Unconscious of his wrong, and burn&rsquo;d<br />
To meet the welcome he had earned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In glory&rsquo;s sanguine field.</p>
<p>Cold was the heart he thought his own,<br />
And colder had his welcome grown,<br />
And on his forehead sat a frown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which half his fears revealed.</p>
<p>Unransomed to his Saxon home,<br />
With promises of gifts to come,<br />
Southward he bade De Breos roam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave him friendly grasp.</p>
<p>The lady wept, Llewelyn smiled,<br />
&ldquo;Yield not, sweet wife, to sorrow wild,<br />
For friendship is a feeling mild;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hand De Breos clasp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Knight departed on his steed,<br />
With twenty horsemen for his need,<br />
To guard him over mount and mead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To fair Montgomory.</p>
<p>But, when he saw the Knight depart,<br />
Full jealous grew Llewelyn&rsquo;s heart,<br />
&ldquo;Oh can dissimulation&rsquo;s dart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Live in Johanna&rsquo;s eye?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>Dark
rumours reached his tortured ear,<br />
He gazed upon his lady near,<br />
And vengeance whispered &ldquo;Chieftain, here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must the foul spoiler die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A month had scarcely rolled away,<br />
When to the Knight, so proud and gay,<br />
Predestined for revenge&rsquo;s prey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He sent a Herald light.</p>
<p>With soothing speech, and present rare,<br />
And invitation to repair<br />
With speed of horse, and heedful care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Aber&rsquo;s Castle bright.</p>
<p>The Herald well De Breos knew,<br />
On wings of guilty love he flew,<br />
His foul dishonour to renew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With great Llewelyn&rsquo;s dame.</p>
<p>But fatal was the meeting now,<br />
Llewelyn knit his dreadful brow,<br />
His angry blood began to glow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in his eye was flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with the slave to dungeon dark!<br />
Disgrace to knighthood, hear and mark!<br />
Upon the gibbet, cold and stark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To-morrow shalt thou hang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more to whisper, fawn and lie&mdash;<br />
No more to gaze with wanton eye,<br />
No more to mix with chivalry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or hear its martial clang.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
367</span>Johanna knows not of the fate<br />
That on her paramour doth wait;<br />
But e&rsquo;er the sun through heaven&rsquo;s gate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolls forth to gild the sea;</p>
<p>Three taps upon her chamber door,<br />
Hath roused her from her dreams of yore,<br />
And stern upon her rush-strewn floor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Llewelyn doth she see.</p>
<p>He seized her by the raven hair<br />
&ldquo;What wouldst thou give, my lady fair.<br />
To see that Knight, so debonair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; De Breos, once again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strong Aber&rsquo;s castle which we dwell in,<br />
Wales, fair England, and Llewelyn,<br />
All I&rsquo;d give to see my Gwilym,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But all I wish in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dragged her from her secret bower,<br />
While thunder on his brow did lower,<br />
And pointed to the falcon tower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, false dame,&rdquo; he cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold once more the traitor fell,<br />
On gallows hung, while fiends in hell<br />
Are shouting forth his passing knell.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lady looked&mdash;and died.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The road from Aber to Bangor is replete with interesting
scenery.&nbsp; The mountains assume a <a name="page368"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 368</span>dark and gloomy grandeur, half clad
in rolling vapours, which at intervals reveal their black and
purple forms, their barren summits and deep hollows, to the
eye.&nbsp; Towering above them all, Benclog rises conspicuous,
into whose threatening gorge the road to Capel Curig winds, like
a snake venturing into some monster&rsquo;s jaws which appears
ready to devour it.&nbsp; Upon the right, the shores of Anglesea,
with its luxuriant woods, are seen stretching down to the Menai,
and agreeably diversify the scene.&nbsp; Before us rose the lofty
towers of Penrhyn Castle, with Port Penrhyn and its shipping in
the distance.&nbsp; Altogether, the prospect is glorious, and the
finest effects I ever saw produced by mountain scenery are
continually varying here; for, however bright the day may be upon
the straights, and along their shores, the Canaervonshire
mountains are generally half concealed by mists, upon which the
sunbeams fall, causing them to assume countless hues of the most
brilliant nature, which contrast finely with the ponderous forms
round which they play in never ceasing variety.</p>
<p>Near the spot where the London road branches off from the
Chester, is the grand entrance to Penrhyn Castle, the property of
G. H. D. Pennant <a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>Esq.&nbsp; The lodge is a beautiful specimen of
substantial architecture; it is protected by a corresponding
gateway, massive and imposing.&nbsp; The park wall extends
circularly seven miles, and is thirteen feet high.&nbsp; To
describe the magnificence of the interior of the castle I feel
would prove a vain effort, and I earnestly recommend all tourists
who take this route not to quit the neighbourhood without seeing
it, or they will be reproached for slighting one of the grandest
treats old Cambria can afford them.</p>
<h3>BANGOR.</h3>
<p>This town derives its name from Ban Cor, which means the high
choir.</p>
<p>We stopped at the Penrhyn Arms, a most commodious inn, which
is capable, it is said, of making up one hundred beds
nightly.&nbsp; It occupies a commanding situation, and from the
back premises embraces a noble prospect&mdash;the straights, the
shore of Anglesea, the bay of Beaumauris, Penrhyn Castle, Puffin
Island, Paenman Mawr, and the Great Orme&rsquo;s Head, with the
ocean in the distance.</p>
<p>There are other excellent inns in the town, <a
name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 370</span>namely the
Castle, the Liverpool arms, and the Albion: the latter, kept by
Hughs, is extremely comfortable, and the landlord civil and
obliging, as I most willingly testify from experience.&nbsp;
There is no place in Wales so well calculated for a tourist to
make his head quarters as Bangor.&nbsp; The various spots he may
visit by appropriating a day to each, would supply him with
gratification for a month at least.</p>
<h3>THE CATHEDRAL</h3>
<p>was founded by Maelgwn Gwynedd, King of Wales, of whom I have
had occasion to speak before, as the patron of Taliesin, the
celebrated Welsh bard.</p>
<p>The original edifice, which was erected in 525, was destroyed
in 1071, and rebuilt shortly after, but was again reduced to
ruins by Owen Glyndwr, and for ninety years was neglected, until
Bishop Dean restored the choir, and the body of the tower was
rebuilt by Bishop Skeffington, in 1532, which still remains in a
perfect state of preservation.&nbsp; The free school was founded
in 1557, by Dr. Jeffry Glynn, upon the site of an ancient parish
church, built by King Edgar, <a name="page371"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 371</span>within about 400 yards of the
present cathedral, and is considered an excellent preparatory
seminary for Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
<p>The remains of an ancient castle, built by Hugh Lupus, Earl of
Chester, in the reign of Henry II, are still visible upon a rock
opposite to the free school, and some pieces of scoria, found on
the spot, lead us to suppose arrows were manufactured
there.&nbsp; At the back of the friar&rsquo;s school is another
hill, and on the top of it are the remains of a British
encampment.</p>
<p>The town, within the last twenty years, has been extended to
nearly four times its original magnitude, and possesses an
appearance of cleanliness particularly gratifying.&nbsp; The
London mail passes to and fro every day, as does the Chester and
Liverpool; and two daily coaches also start for London, one to
Chester and Liverpool, two to Caernarvon, and a mail to
Pwllheli.&nbsp; The great lion of Bangor is</p>
<h3>THE MENAI BRIDGE.</h3>
<p>The principal opening between the supporting pyramids is 560
feet in breadth, through which the vessels pass with all their
canvass set, without the least danger of their masts touching the
<a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
372</span>overhanging bridge.&nbsp; There are four stone arches
upon the Anglesea side, and three upon the Carnaervon, which
complete the road way, and have each a span of fifty feet.&nbsp;
The length of the bridge is 800 feet, and its height is 100 feet
above the surface of the Menai at high water.&nbsp; The weight of
the bridge and its suspending chains, between the pyramids, is
six hundred and thirty-nine tons, nineteen hundred and nine
pounds; and that of the ironwork from one extremity of the chains
to the other is estimated at 2130 tons, 1800 consisting of
wrought, and three hundred and thirty of cast iron.</p>
<p>The first stone of this astonishing work was laid by W. A.
Provis Esq., on the 10th August, 1820; and on the 20th April,
1825, the first main chain was thrown across the strait.&nbsp;
This important step being completed, three of the workmen, in the
height of their enthusiasm, ventured to walk along the chain from
pyramid to pyramid; and a cobbler no less daring and
enthusiastic, seated himself in the centre of the curve, and,
while suspended at the fearful height, with sky above and the
deep water of the strait gliding beneath him, drove the last
sparable into one of those convenient comforts called clogs.</p>
<p><a name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 373</span>The
view from the centre of the bridge beggars description.&nbsp;
Waving woods, barren precipices, distant mountains, Bangor and
Beaumauris, Penrhyn Castle, Paenman Mawr, the Great Orme&rsquo;s
Head, the ocean, and the strait, are objects that dazzle and
astonish from the exquisite beauty of their natural
arrangement.</p>
<p>My task is done.&nbsp; I have taken leave of my phrenological
friend; the steam boat is dropping slowly to Garth point to take
in passengers for Liverpool; and I must now quit this lovely
land&mdash;never perhaps to see it more.&nbsp; But let me hope
the sketches I have given of its various charms will induce
others to take the path which I have pursued with so much
pleasure.&nbsp; It leads through the most interesting portion of
the country.&nbsp; For the artist, there is an inexhaustible
store of beauty.&nbsp; The geologist and mineralogist will find
the lore they thirst for, in almost every hill and valley,
through which they pass.&nbsp; The smoke-dried citizen may have
the London <i>blacks</i> blown from his garments by the healthful
mountain breeze, and drink huge draughts of the pure air until he
feels intoxicated with pleasure, while he is enabled to supply
himself cheaply with a valuable stock of delightful recollections
that will enable him, at any time, to raise a visionary paradise
<a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 374</span>around
him&mdash;to banish painful thoughts; for, in fine, pain must
give place to pleasure, gloom to sunshine, blue devils to
hilarity, and sickness to invigorating health, in the enchanting
principality of <span class="smcap">North Wales</span>.</p>

375</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<h3>SNOWDON</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">First</span> received its name from the
Saxons, and signifies a mountain covered with snow.&nbsp; It was
held sacred by the Ancient Britons, who believed that those who
slept upon it became inspired.&nbsp; The perpendicular height of
the mountain is 1190 yards, and, as the state of the atmosphere
hindered me from attempting the ascent, I have selected the
accounts of the most celebrated tourists for the benefit of those
who may be more fortunate than I was.</p>
<h3>MR. PENNANT&rsquo;S ASCENT.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Ascend above <i>Cwm Brwynog</i> a very deep
bottom.&nbsp; In the course of our ascent, saw on the left above
the Cwm, <i>Moel y Cynghorion</i>, or the Hill of Council; pass
through <i>Bwlch Maes-y-cwm</i>, and skirt the side of Snowdon,
till we reach <i>Bwlch Cwm Brwynog</i>, where the ascent becomes
very difficult on account of its vast steepness; people here
usually quit their horses.&nbsp; We began a toilsome march,
clambering among the rocks.&nbsp; On the left were the precipices
over <i>Brwynog</i> with <i>Llyn Du yr Arddwy</i> at their foot;
on our right, were those over the small lakes <i>Llyn
Gl&acirc;s</i>, <i>Llyn y Naddroed</i>, and <i>Llyn
C&ocirc;ch</i>.&nbsp; The last is the <a name="page376"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 376</span>highest on this side the mountain;
and on whose margins, we were told that in fairy days, those
diminutive gentry kept their revels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This space between precipice and precipice formed a
short and no very agreeable isthmus, till we reached a verdant
expanse which gave us some respite before we laboured up another
series of broken crags; after these is a second smooth tract,
which reaches almost to the summit, and by way of pre-eminence is
styled <i>Y Wyddfa</i>, or The Conspicuous.&nbsp; It rises almost
to a point, or at least there is but room for a circular wall of
loose stones, within which travellers usually take their
repast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The view from this exalted situation is
unbounded.&nbsp; In a former tour I saw from it the hills of
Yorkshire, part of the north of England, Scotland, and Ireland; a
plain view of the Isle of Man, and that of Anglesey lay extended
like a map beneath me with every rill visible.&nbsp; I took much
pains to see this prospect to advantage, sat up at a farm on the
west till about twelve, and walked up the whole way.&nbsp; The
night was remarkably fine and starry: towards morn, the stars
faded away, and left a short interval of darkness, which soon
dispersed by the dawning of the day.&nbsp; The body of the sun
appeared most distinct with the rotundity of the moon, before it
rose high enough to render its beams too brilliant for our
sight.&nbsp; The sea which bounded the western part was gilt by
its rays, first in slender streaks, at length glowing with
redness.&nbsp; The prospect was disclosed like the gradual
drawing up of a curtain in a theatre.&nbsp; We saw more and more
till the heat became so powerful as to attract the mists from the
various lakes, which in a slight degree obscured the
prospect.&nbsp; The shadow of the mountain was flung many miles,
and shewed its bicapitated form; the <i>Wyddfa</i> making one,
<i>Crib y Dysdyll</i> the other head.&nbsp; <a
name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 377</span>I counted
this time between twenty and thirty lakes either in this county,
or Merionethshire.&nbsp; The day proved so excessively hot, that
my journey cost me the skin of the lower part of my face before I
reached the resting place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another visit, the same celebrated traveller
remarks&mdash;&ldquo;On this day, the sky was obscured very soon
after I got up; a vast mist enveloped the whole circuit of the
mountain; the prospect down was horrible.&nbsp; It gave an idea
of numbers of abysses concealed by a thick smoke, furiously
circulating round us.&nbsp; Very often a gust of wind formed an
opening in the clouds, which gave a fine and distinct view of
lake and valley.&nbsp; Sometimes, they opened only in one place,
at others in many at once, exhibiting a most strange and
perplexing view of water, fields, rocks or chasms, in fifty
different places.&nbsp; They then closed at once, and left us
involved in darkness; in a short time, they would separate again,
and fly in wild eddies round the middle of the mountains, and
expose in parts both tops and bases clear to our view.&nbsp; We
descended from this various scene with great reluctance, but
before we reached our horses a thunder storm overtook us.&nbsp;
Its rolling among the mountains was inexpressibly awful, the rain
uncommonly heavy.&nbsp; We remounted our horses, and gained the
bottom with great hazard.&nbsp; The little rills which on our
ascent trickled along the gullies on the sides of the mountain,
were now swelled into torrents, and we and our steeds passed with
the utmost risk of being swept away by these sudden waters.&nbsp;
At length, we arrived safe, yet sufficiently wet and weary, to
our former quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very seldom that the traveller gets a propitious
day to ascend Snowdon; for often when it appears clear, it
becomes suddenly and unexpectedly enveloped in mist by its <a
name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 378</span>attraction
of clouds, which just before seemed remote and at great
heights.&nbsp; At times, I have observed them lower to half their
heights, and notwithstanding they have been dispersed to the
right and to the left, yet they have met from both sides and
united to involve the summit in one great obscurity.&nbsp; The
quantity of water which flows from the lakes of Snowdonia is very
considerable; so much, that I doubt not but collectively they
would exceed the waters of the Thames before it meets the conflux
of the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>MR. BINGLEY&rsquo;S ASCENT.</h3>
<p>This industrious and persevering traveller observes: &ldquo;I
had made a determination soon after I came into Wales, that I
would ascend Snowdon by all the tracks that are usually pointed
out to travellers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This gentleman had already
accomplished the task in three instances, his routes being first
from D&ocirc;lbadarn Castle, secondly from Llanberis, and thirdly
from Llyn Cwellyn.&nbsp; The fourth, the description of which we
are about to borrow, as more descriptive than any of the others,
is the route from Bedd-gelert.&nbsp; He says: &ldquo;The distance
from Bedd-gelert to the summit, being reckoned not less than six
miles, and a lady being one of our number, it was thought most
eligible for her to ride as far as she could without danger, and
for the rest to walk the whole of the way.&nbsp; In this manner
therefore, we set out, commencing our <i>mountain</i> journey by
turning to the right, from the Caernarvon road, at the distance
of about two miles and a half from the village.&nbsp; We left the
horse at a cottage, about half way up, from whence taking a <a
name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 379</span>bottle of
milk to mix with some rum that we had brought along with us, we
continued our route over a series of pointed and craggy
rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stopping at different times to rest, we enjoyed to the
utmost the prospects that by degrees were opening round us.&nbsp;
Caernarvon and the Isle of Anglesey, aided by the brightness of
the morning, were seen to great advantage; and Cwellyn below us,
shaded by the vast Mynydd Mawr, with Castell Cidwu at its foot,
appeared extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In ascending the mountains, which from below seemed of
immense height, they began now to appear beneath us; the lakes
and valleys were more exposed, and all the little rills and
mountain streams by degrees became visible to us, like silver
lines intersecting the hollows around.&nbsp; Towards the upper
part of the mountain, we passed over a tremendous ridge of rock,
called <i>Clawdd C&ocirc;ch</i>, the Red Ridge.&nbsp; This narrow
pass, not more than ten or twelve feet across, and two or three
hundred yards in length was so steep that the eye reached on each
side, down the whole extent of the mountain.&nbsp; And I am
persuaded that in some parts of it if a person held a large stone
in each hand, and let them both fell at once, each might roll
above a quarter of a mile, and thus when they stopped they might
be more than half a mile asunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady who accompanied us, to my great surprise,
passed the ridge without the least apparent signs of fear or
trepidation.&nbsp; There is no danger whatever in passing Clawdd
C&ocirc;ch in the day-time, but I must confess that I should by
no means like to venture along this tract in the night, as many
do who have never seen it.&nbsp; If the moon shone very bright,
we might, it is true, escape unhurt, but a dark cloud coming
suddenly over would certainly expose us to much danger.&nbsp;
Many instances have occurred of persons who having passed over it
in the <a name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
380</span>night were so terrified at seeing it by daylight the
next morning, that they have not dared to return the same way,
but have gone a very circuitous round by Bettws.&nbsp; I was
informed that one gentleman had been so much alarmed, that he
crawled over it back again on his hands and knees.&nbsp; In the
hollow on the left of the ascent are four small pools, called
<i>Llyn C&ocirc;ch</i>, the red pool; <i>Llyn Gl&acirc;s</i>, the
blue pool; <i>Llyn y Nadroedd</i>, the adder&rsquo;s pool; and
<i>Llyn Ffynnon y Gw&acirc;s</i>, the servant&rsquo;s pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon after we had passed Clawdd C&ocirc;ch, we became
immersed in light clouds, till we arrived at the summit of the
mountain, when a single gleam of sunshine, which lasted but for a
moment, presented us with the majestic scenery on the west of our
station.&nbsp; It served only, however, to tantalize our hopes;
for a smart gust of wind again obscured us in clouds.&nbsp; We
now sheltered ourselves from the cold, under some of the
projecting rocks near the top, and ate our dinners, watching with
anxiety the dark shades in the clouds, in hopes that a separation
might take place, and that we should be once more delighted with
a sight of the grand objects around us.&nbsp; We did not watch in
vain, for the clouds by degrees cleared away, and left us at full
liberty to admire the numerous beauties in this expansive
scene.&nbsp; The steep rock of <i>Clogwn y Garnedd</i>, whose
dreadful precipices are some of them above two hundred yards in
perpendicular height, and the whole rock, a series of precipices,
was an object which first struck one of my companions with
terror, and he exclaimed almost involuntarily,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How
fearful<br />
And dizzy &rsquo;tis to cast one&rsquo;s eye so low!<br />
The crows and choughs that wing the mid-way air<br />
Scarce shew so gross as beetles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We now stood on a point which commanded the whole <a
name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 381</span>dome of the
sky.&nbsp; The prospects below, each of which we had before
considered separately as a grand scene, were now only miniature
parts of the immense landscape.&nbsp; We had around us such a
variety of mountains, valleys, lakes, and streams, each receding
behind the ether, and bounded only by the far distant horizon,
that the eye almost strained itself with looking upon them.&nbsp;
These majestic prospects were soon shut from our sight by the
gathering clouds, which now began to close in much heavier than
they had done before; and it was in vain that we waited near an
hour for another opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were, therefore, at length obliged to descend, in
despair of being any more gratified with these sublime
prospects.&nbsp; We again passed Clawd C&ocirc;ch, and soon
afterwards, turning to the left, descended into the mountain
vale, called <i>Cwm Llan</i>.&nbsp; We followed the course of a
stream, which flows from thence into Llyn y Dinas, in Nant
Gwynant.&nbsp; This little rivulet entertained us much in its
descent, being in many places thrown over low rocks, forming
small but sometimes elegant cascades.&nbsp; After a walk of two
hours, we arrived in Nant Hwynan, the vale that I had traversed
with so much pleasure a day or two before; and passing by Llyn y
Dinas, and Dinas Emrys, soon afterwards reached Bedd-gelert, not
a little fatigued with our mountain ramble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I observed near a cottage in Cwm Llan, that several
children were employed in gathering the berries of the mountain
ash.&nbsp; On inquiring of the guide to what purpose this was
done, he informed me that the Welsh people brew from them a
liquor which they call <i>D&iuml;od Gr&iuml;afol</i>.&nbsp; This,
he said, was done by merely crushing the berries, and putting
water to them, which, after remaining a fortnight, is drawn off
for use.&nbsp; The flavour, as I understood him, was somewhat
like that of perry.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page382"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
382</span>ASCENT FROM DOLBADARN.</h3>
<p>This account is taken from a small useful publication,
entitled &ldquo;Guide to Bangor, Beaumaris, and Snowdonia,&rdquo;
by Mr. John Smith, of Liverpool.&nbsp; The narrative is written
by a friend of Mr. Smith, who, the latter informs us, was a
companion of the late lamented Belzoni, and the period when the
ascent was performed was the summer of 1825.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about half-past twelve when we left our inn at
D&ocirc;lbadarn, and I think a more lovely morning we could not
be favoured with: nature did indeed seem at rest; not a cloud
appeared to move, and a bright and nearly full moon, which had
passed the meridian, seemed as if waiting to light us on our
way.&nbsp; Our party consisted of three of the ladies, (the
fourth not having strength for the task) Mr. M., myself, two
gentlemen who joined us at D&ocirc;lbadarn, our guide, and his
faithful dog.&nbsp; The ladies were furnished with a stout pony
each, but the gentlemen preferred climbing on foot the steep
ascent, and I believe, before they returned, repented heartily
having done so.&nbsp; The guide was equipped with a leathern
belt, to which was buckled a tin vessel containing water, and a
staff which seemed well worn with the hard service in which it
was employed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We proceeded across a small rivulet a short distance
from the inn, and soon entered on a kind of mountain horse-path,
composed of loose slate and stones, of which our pedestrians soon
began to be weary.&nbsp; After ascending this about a mile, we
arrived at a rough fence of turf and stones, where the road wound
round the side of a mountain, and entered a kind of defile,
through which we had to proceed.&nbsp; Here our guide desired us
to look back at the view beneath us, and when we <a
name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 383</span>did so, our
feelings and expressions of delight and astonishment were
general.&nbsp; Below us, the lake of Llanberis lay stretched like
an immense mirror in the shade, with one bright silvery ray
resting on its glassy surface, in which part of the steep
mountains that surrounded it appeared reflected.&nbsp; To attempt
to describe the beautiful and varying tints on those mountains
would be as useless a task, as the most vivid colours would be
foolishly employed in trying to represent them.&nbsp; In the
distance and on our right, D&ocirc;lbadarn tower was just visible
at the head of the lower lake, and on our left the inn,
surrounded with the only trees in the neighbourhood, formed a
striking object: we reflected with pleasure, as we looked towards
it, that the lady whose health would not allow her to accompany
us, was there enjoying a refreshing sleep, and would, when awake,
be anxiously waiting for our return, and to hear the various
accounts we should give of our expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We again turned our faces towards Snowdon, on the same
road I have before mentioned, and the mild, yet awful and
magnificent scene before us afforded abundant themes for
conversation and remark.&nbsp; In three or four places light
fleecy clouds, edged with silver by the moonbeam, and which at
first appeared resting on the sides of the mountains, now seemed
to be slowly rolling down their steep sides, and generally mixing
with the deep gloom of the valleys below us.&nbsp; Though
surrounded by nature&rsquo;s grandest works, I fancy some of the
party were tired even here, as many inquiries had been made
relative to the distance we had still to proceed.&nbsp; However,
the guide, suddenly stopping, informed us we were now at the
&lsquo;half-way house;&rsquo; but no house was to be seen, and on
looking round for it, we could perceive nothing but a small
stream which trickled down the steep, and which replenished our
guide&rsquo;s water vessel, <a name="page384"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 384</span>which had been emptied some time
before by the continual demands upon it. <a
name="citation384"></a><a href="#footnote384"
class="citation">[384]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;We had proceeded now about three miles, and left our
slate road by passing through a small wicket which opened on the
heath, near which the sagacity of one of the ponys surprised
us.&nbsp; The poor animal was blind, and on arriving within three
feet of the wicket, which was open, it drew up, and would not
proceed till led through by the bridle.&nbsp; One would fancy it
had almost numbered its paces.&nbsp; It is surprising with what
safety and agility these animals walk over the steep paths and
stones they have to pass; and the guide assured us that he had
been in the habit of going with travellers nearly twenty years,
and never knew a single accident occasioned by them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soft heath we were now passing was a relief to our
feet, though it was so steep that we were sometimes obliged to
wait to regain breath.&nbsp; At this time, we were on the top of
a hill, which we fancied was the last we had to mount before the
peak of Snowdon, and willingly thought the summit of the bold
front before us was to be the end of our journey.&nbsp; Thence
the way was over a kind of ridge, perhaps forty yards wide, one
side of which was perpendicular for several hundred feet, and the
other so steep that no one could stop or steady himself upon
it.&nbsp; Daylight now began to appear, to show us more
distinctly the steeps we were amongst; and, though we well knew
the breadth of the ridge was such that there could be no danger,
yet I am sure we all felt that unpleasant sensation which few can
approach the edge of a precipice without experiencing in some
degree.&nbsp; Tremendous gusts of wind, too, which passed the
long heath with a singular whizzing noise, giving warning of
their approach, and almost blowing us off our feet as they
assailed us, did not make any of us feel easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, we went boldly on without accident, except a
<a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 385</span>hat and
bonnet blowing off, which were fortunately recovered, and nearly
reached the top of what we had all taken to be our
journey&rsquo;s end, when the guide exclaimed, pointing to a high
peak before us, &ldquo;There is Snowdon top;&rdquo; and we had
the mortification to find that we had still a climbing of
three-quarters of a mile before us.&nbsp; This powerfully
reminded us of a couplet by Pope:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The increasing prospect tires our wandering
eyes,<br />
Hills peep o&rsquo;er hills, and alps on alps arise.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few minutes more brought us to a small inclosure of stones,
where the horses were put up, as they could proceed no further,
and now the ladies were obliged to foot it.&nbsp; Here one of the
gentlemen gave in, declaring he would proceed no further, and
laid down on the moss, saying he would wait our return.&nbsp;
Perhaps a little rest was of service to him, for he afterwards
joined us on the top of Snowdon.&nbsp; The road here is along the
edge of the steep side of the mountain, which is almost
perpendicular, and is broken with large fragments of slate,
stone, and spar, of various kinds, to the very summit, which to
our great joy, we at last attained about half-past four
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Had we waited for months we could not have
had a more beautiful time; as the guide expressed himself,
&lsquo;Snowdon has its days, and this is one of
them.&rsquo;&nbsp; We sat down; in a few minutes the moon, which
had so favoured us, declined behind one of the western mountains,
and almost at the same instant the red tints on the eastern
horizon foretold the approach of the king of day, the effect of
whose rising on such a scene as that below and around us, was the
most magnificent sight we ever beheld.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The descent is not related by the writer of the above
description.&nbsp; I understand, however, it was merrily
performed by all the party, whose fatigue in the expedition well
qualified <a name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
386</span>them to feel the luxury of a few hours&rsquo; repose at
D&ocirc;lbadarn.</p>
<h3>PROSPECT FROM THE SUMMIT.</h3>
<p>In the foregoing descriptions by three of our most respectable
tourists, sufficient is contained to afford the traveller a
tolerably good idea of the nature of the ascent to the top of
Snowdon; and we shall only add the subjoined animated description
of a view from its summit, by the author of the &ldquo;Beauties,
Harmonies, and Sublimities of Nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After climbing over masses of crags and rocks, we
ascended the peak of Snowdon.&nbsp; Arrived at its summit, a
scene presented itself, magnificent beyond the powers of
language!&nbsp; Indeed, language is indigent and impotent when it
would presume to sketch scenes on which the Great Eternal has
placed his matchless finger with delight.&nbsp; Faint are thy
broad and deep delineations, immortal Salvator Rosa!&nbsp;
Powerless and feeble are your inspirations, genius of Thompson,
Virgil, and Lucretius!</p>
<p>&ldquo;From this point are seen five-and-twenty
lakes.&mdash;Seated on one of the crags, it was long before the
eye, unaccustomed to measure such elevations, could accommodate
itself to scenes so admirable:&mdash;the whole appearing as if
there had been a war of the elements; and as if we were the only
inhabitants of the globe permitted to contemplate the ruins of
the world.&nbsp; Rocks and mountains, which when observed from
below, bear all the evidence of sublimity, when viewed from the
summit of Snowdon, are blended with others as dark, as rugged,
and as elevated as themselves; the whole resembling the swellings
of an agitated ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The extent of this prospect appears almost
unlimited.&nbsp; The <a name="page387"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 387</span>four kingdoms are seen at once:
Wales, England, Scotland, and Ireland! forming the finest
panorama the empire can boast.&nbsp; The circle begins with the
mountains of Cumberland and Westmorland; those of Ingleborough
and Penygent, in the county of York, and the hills of Lancashire
follow; then are observed the counties of Chester, Flint,
Denbigh, and a portion of Montgomeryshire.&nbsp; Nearly the whole
of Merioneth succeeds; and drawing a line with the eye along the
diameter of the circle, we take in the regions stretching from
the triple crown of Cader Idris to the sterile crags of
Carnedds-David and Llewellyn.&nbsp; Snowdon, rising in the
centre, appears as if he could touch the south with his right
hand, and the north with his left.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo;
thought Colonna, &lsquo;C&aelig;sar sat upon these crags when he
formed the daring conception of governing the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Cader Idris the eye, pursuing the orbit of the
bold geographical line, glances over the bay of Cardigan, and
reposes for a while on the summit of the Rivals.&mdash;After
observing the indented shores of Caernarvonshire, it travels over
a long line of ocean, till in the extremity of the horizon the
blue mountains of Wicklow terminate the perspective.&nbsp; Those
mountains gradually sink along the coast till they are lost to
the eye; which ranging along the expanse, at length, as weary of
the journey, reposes on the Island of Man, and the distant
mountains of Scotland.&nbsp; The intermediate space is occupied
by the sides and summits of mountains, hollow crags, masses of
rocks, the towers of Caernarvon, the fields of Anglesea, with
woods, lakes, and glens, scattered in magnificent confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scene like this commands our feelings to echo, as it
were, in unison to its grandeur and sublimity.&nbsp; The thrill
of astonishment, and the transport of imagination seem to contend
for the mastery, and nerves are touched that never thrilled
before.&nbsp; We seem as if our former existence were
annihilated, <a name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
388</span>and as a new epoch were commenced.&nbsp; Another world
opens upon us; and an unlimited orbit appears to display itself
as a theatre for our ambition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among other ceremonies performed in the preparations for
knighthood, the candidate went into a bath, which was symbolical
of the purity of the soul.&nbsp; He was then placed in a bed,
which signified the rest he was hereafter to enjoy in Paradise;
and when he had slept, the Neophyte was clothed in a shirt, which
white dress betokened the purity of his new
character.&mdash;<i>See Miles&rsquo;s History of
Chivalry</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The lady looked&mdash;and died.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to poetical justice she certainly should have
died.&nbsp; But the lady recovered, and her good natured lord not
only forgave her this slip, but many others of a similar nature,
and for her <i>earthly virtues</i> had her proclaimed a
<i>heavenly saint</i>, after she had paid the debt of nature.</p>

The dew was on the flower;<br />
The bee had sought his honey comb,<br />
The bird was in his bower;<br />
When swifter than the mountain gale,<br />
On Alban steed I flew<br />
My bee I sought your honey home;<br />
My bird I flew to you.<br />
My bee I sought your honey home;<br />
My bird I flew to you.</p>
<p>My peerless steed is white with foam<br />
And droops his arched neck;<br />
The flood, the mountain, and the glen,<br />
He crossed without a cheek.<br />
Oh! listen while my harp I strike,<br />
And rouse its sweetest tone;<br />
And hear the language of a heart,<br />
Which beats for you alone.</p>
<p>The breeze hath left the Berwyn hills,<br />
The dew is on the flower;<br />
And I must hie to fairy land,<br />
Ere chimes the midnight hour.<br />
Arise bright star of beauty rise,<br />
And when from you I roam,<br />
Send forth the lustre of your eyes<br />
To light me to my home.</p>

Drums loudly rattle,<br />
Trumpets are braying,<br />
Proud steeds are neighing,<br />

Spring up together,<br />

From the heart&rsquo;s fountain,<br />
Sons of the mountain,<br />

England advances,<br />
Proud of her lances,<br />

Davies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fairest of Ladies,<br />
And dwell on the bank-side where primroses grow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My cheeks are like cherries,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My lips sweet strawberries,<br />
My eyes are as black as the wild mountain sloe.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart&rsquo;s warm and tender,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My waist small and slender,<br />
I bound o&rsquo;er the hills like the young mountain row;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blithesome and witty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then sure &rsquo;tis a pity,<br />
That I for a husband should sight forth heigh ho!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sighing and suing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Young Arthur came wooing,<br />
But he was too shy for a buxom young lass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then came handsome Harry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who press&rsquo;d me to marry,<br />
But he was too fond of his toilet and glass;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then followed brave Rowland,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who lives in the low-land,<br />
But he was too rough for a delicate maid;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, sure &rsquo;tis a pity,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A young girl so pretty,<br />
Should sigh for a husband and pine in the shade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Carlie abused me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sadly misused me,<br />
He vow&rsquo;d to be mine and ran off with Miss Jones;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And last came a Quaker,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A grave undertaker,<br />
Who promis&rsquo;d he&rsquo;d soon make me bone of his bones;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But he late and early<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is peevish and surly,<br />
No longer I smile, and to dance I&rsquo;m afraid;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t bear to choose
him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet if I lose him,<br />
Perhaps, (Oh, my stars!) I shall die an old maid.</p>

<p class="poetry">The sun had gone down, and the monarch of
mountains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had robed his dark form in a mantle of cloud;<br />
The primroses slept by the summer dried fountains,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And beauty&rsquo;s own river seem&rsquo;d dreaming
aloud.<br />
In the dale of the Hazel all nature seem&rsquo;d weeping,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And mild was the moon-light that silver&rsquo;d the
grove;<br />
But wakeful was morn flew my own mountain Mary,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To gladden my heart with the breathings of love.</p>
<p class="poetry">She looked down to blush, from the gaze of her
lover,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her snowy lids veiling her heaven-blue eyes;<br />
More sweet was her breath than the dew-sprinkled clover,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When morning first breaks through the gates of the
skies.<br />
The land-breeze sprang up, and my bark tripp&rsquo;d her
anchor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah me, how we started to feel that fair wind,<br />
&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the dear dale of the
Hazel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And poor mountain Mary left weeping
behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Far, far did I wander in climes hotly
burning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till fortune repaid me with wealth in good store;<br

Then swift as a bird&rsquo;s flight o&rsquo;er high waves
returning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our vessel was wafted to Abermaw&rsquo;s shore.<br

With the speed of the roe-buck I flew to my Mary,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Joy&rsquo;s tears from her eyes fell like midsummer
rain;<br />
And now in Dolgelley by wedlock united,<br />

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
